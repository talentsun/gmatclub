    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>这句话的主要着重点是D选项上用as，而正确选项是用的informing，是状语。区别在于，【，V-ing】结构很明显在这句话里是起到状语的结构，是对前句的一个补充说明；而as的话，引导的是状语从句，但是as有一种用法是做because的意思来讲，所以OG说unclear and appears to indicate the meaning "due to"</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><br></span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>Furthermore, the comparison is ambiguous: did his knowledge inform his style as much as it informed the content, ox did it inform his style as much as the content informed his style?</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><br></span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">这句话，着重点是在as much as上，D选项后半句话是a</span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>s it informed his literary style as much as </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>the content of his fiction</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>C选项用both... and的结构，很清楚的表现出是inform both A and B, 也就是说inform的宾语是A和B两者，这点在C里很清楚。然而D却可以有两种解释，</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>1）as it(指代knowledge) informed his literacy style as much as the content of his fiction (informed) 也就是是knowledge和content of his fiction并列，同时作为informed的主语</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span>2) as it informed his literacy style as much as the content of his fiction 这个就和C选项一致，即而这都作为informed的宾语</span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><span><br></span></span><br><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">尽管后者才是作者真正想表达的意思，但是用as much as会造成理解为第一种的歧义，而且但就这题而言肯定没有both... and来的清晰。所以，最后D被X掉了</span></p></div>
