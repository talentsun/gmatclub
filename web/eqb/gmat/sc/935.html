    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>1.a million or more或者more than a million, 但不说a million and more</p>
<p>2.后面的中心词是可数名词时，应该是as many as，而不是as much as。注意：本句中该结构后中心词是others(人),是可数的。</p>
<p>3. had表示“拥有”时是个普通动词，不能像助动词或情态动词那样直接在其后加not构成否定句。但no表示“没有”时，其实修饰的是名词，而非动词，所以任何及物动词后都可以出现no。如：I have no friend(s). I see no houses cross the street.</p>
<p>因为前两条原因，A和B都不对。因为第三条原因，C不对。</p>
<p>至于E, 很简单，应该是there were而不是 there was，没看到后面的名词是复数吗？</p></div>
