    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>考点: 习惯用语（Idiom） 句子结构（Grammatical Construction）</p>
<p>习惯用法: recommend sth., recommend that (使用虚拟语气), recommend doing sth. 在require, demand等表"建议,命令"意义的词之后的that从句,要求用虚拟语气动词,即动词原形,不 加should</p>
<p>(A) and even their being removed表达笨拙;</p>
<p>(B) and even that跟cutting back不平行</p>
<p>(C) 使用被动语态,不如主动语态有效；and they…是独立的句子，语法上与主句biologist are recommending…并列，they指代biologist，但根据原句意思，they应指代states，故不符合逻辑。</p>
<p>(D) even their being removed表达笨拙, 并且跟cut bank不平行</p>
<p>(E) 正确，使用recommend that表达虚拟语气, some states cut back …and remove…结构平行句子结构: To help…, biologists are recommending that some states cut back…and even remove…</p></div>
