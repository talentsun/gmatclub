    Deliberately imitating the technique of Louis Armstrong, jazz singer <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Billie Holiday's approach to singing was to use her voice like an instrument, in that she ranged freely over the beat, flattened</span> out the melodic contours of tunes, and, in effect, recomposed songs to suit her range, style, and artistic sensibilities.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>我认为解答这道题的关键是找到一个符合parallelism原则的结构，就能轻松找到答案D了。这道题的主结构是：......<span>Billie Holiday's approach to singing was to use her voice like an instrument, in that she ranged ..., flattening</span><span> out ..., and, in effect, recomposed ....也就是说 in that she ranged...and recomposed... 这样也符合句意而且更为简洁。</span></p>
<p><span>另外，现在GMAC很少会考到要用到in that从句的句子了，大家其实可以忽略这种题目的。</span></p>
<p>纯属一家之言。呵呵。</p></div>
