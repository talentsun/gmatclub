    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Looking at A:<br>Lacking an understanding of the earth's massive and complex ecosystem, many people tend to overestimate the importance of organisms, such as human beings, that are at or near the top of the food chain, and underestimate that of micro-organisms, such as plankton, that <span>dwells</span> near the bottom of the food chain .<br><br>This is saying that "micro-organisms, such as plankton, that dwells" which is incorrect because micro-organisms is plural, so "dwell" should be used instead of "dwells"</p>
<p>B,C,E are eliminated because of "it".<br><br>Between A and D , "the importance of organisms, such as human beings, that are at or near the top of the food chain" <br>Singular subject "The importance" requires singular verb so "are" is wrong. <br>Therefore, D is the correct choice.</p></div>
