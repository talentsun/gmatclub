<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>逻辑意思（logical prediction） 句子结构（grammatical construction）</h4>

<ol><li> --ing分词作句首，逻辑主语等于主语。</li>

<li> 所谓的"原句"，"合理重心"，都是根据逻辑意思判断的。特别对于长句子，能够在读题时迅速判断合理重心，是加快做题速度、提高正确率的第一利刃。</li>
<li> estimate的固定用法：</li>
</ol><p>estimate (that)  （不需加原V）</p>
<p>estimate + N + to be N(adj)   (prep 2-51)</p>
<p>estimate + N + at + 价格等数量词  （估价）（除此概念以外优先用estimated to be表达）</p>

<p>如：40 to 44 million years是时间概念，要用estimated to be 40 to 44 million years old.</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. 句子合理重心应该是结论为主句，达成结论的动作过程为辅，所以主从颠倒；定语从句中的they无所指。</li>
<li>B. Correct；Citing在句首，a new study是逻辑主语也是主语；句子重心合理。</li>
<li>C. citing逻辑主语错误，同时致使本应该是核心成分的a new study estimates成了插入语；estimates用现在完成时或者一般过去时问题都不大。</li>
<li>D. 句子重心错误；votes that were cast累赘，因为时态一致，可以省略that were；had been过去完成时错误，没有时间对比说明count这个动作发生在过去的过去(即便count是个瞬间动词，但是在否定句中瞬间动词也可以和表示一段时间的状语、连词连用，而是用完成时态)。</li>
<li>E. had not been时态错误；主谓相隔太远不好；复杂的句式estimate后面补出that更好。</li>
