    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. 第二个发现的内容作为谓语found的宾语，为宾语从句，that不能省略；different shifts from their husbands 将 shifts 与 husbands 相比，比较对象不对等，此处应该使用所有格husbands'"</li>
<li>B. 第二个发现的内容作为谓语found的宾语，为宾语从句，that不能省略</li>
<li>C. 第二个发现的内容作为谓语found的宾语，为宾语从句，that不能省略；when引导时间状语从句， 表达的意思与原句不同；be working时态错误；those of their husbands'为双重所有格，错误， 正确的表达方式应该为those of their husbands，或者their husbands'。</li>
<li>D. 正确。</li>
<li>E. That differed from their husbands修饰对象为shifts，即，将husband与shifts相比较，比较对象 不对等；when引导时间状语从句，表达的意思与原句不同；be working时态错误。</li>
</ul><h3>句子结构</h3>
<p>A survey found that… and that…. 句子描述一个调查的两个发现，两个发现分别由that引起的宾语从句表示，两者平行。</p>
<h3>考点</h3>
<p>句子结构（Grammatical Construction）, 简洁有效（Rhetorical Construction） 宾语从句中的that不能省略。GAMT中，不允许出现双重所有格。</p></div>
