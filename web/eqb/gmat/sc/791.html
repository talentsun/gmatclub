    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>句子结构：Using…, scientists and historians are attempting to clean and preserve… flag that…, hoping that… 现在分词结构在句首作状语，修饰主句主语scientists and historians，谓语是are attempting，后跟不 定式to clean and preserve…作宾语，hoping…分词结构在句尾作伴随状语。</p>
<p>考点：句子结构、逻辑表达 句子结构，当动词在选项中以谓语形式和修饰语成分同时出现时，要特别注意有作修饰语的句子 中是否有主句谓语。 逻辑表达，现在分词结构在句首作状语，其修饰对象（即动作的逻辑主语）是主句主语。</p>
<p>(A) in their attempt at cleaning…名词表达方式不及动词attempt有效，且作为插入语修饰成分，句子 谓语是are hoping that it will…，如果去掉插入语，句子虽然在语法上没有错误，但逻辑表达不清楚， it的指代也不清楚。</p>
<p>(B) 正确，and as ordinary as common dry-cleaning chemicals与前面对称，hoping…作伴随状语。</p>
<p>(C) 句首的分词结构using修饰an attempt对象错误；被动语态表达罗嗦。</p>
<p>(D) but also没有搭配对象，而且不合原意；主语是scientists and historians由who引导的从句修饰， 句子缺少谓语。</p>
<p>(E) but also没有搭配对象；句首的分词结构using修饰an attempt对象错误；主语是attempt，句子缺 少谓语。</p></div>
