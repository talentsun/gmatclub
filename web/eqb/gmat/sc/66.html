    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>题目释义</h3>
<p>The 32 species are related to W and in fact include the animal known as the killer whale, which can grow to be 30 feet long and is famous for…</p>
<h3>考点</h3>
<p>逻辑意思（logical prediction） 平行结构（parallelism） 习惯用语（idiom） 主谓一致（agreement）</p>
<ol><li>如果前面主句是主谓宾结构(非主系表结构)，现在分词在句尾做状语。</li>
<li>grow as big as 40 feet和grow to be 30 feet long意思相同。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Correct；which指代the killer whale，grow to和is famous for平行。</li>
<li>B. growing做伴随状语修饰了谓语动词include及其主语the 32 species，错误；as big as和long重复，用一个就好(size和length是同一概念)。</li>
<li>C. growing错误同B。being+adj.错误。</li>
<li>D. includes应用复数形式，因为主语是the 32 species，且与其平行的谓语动词用了are；grow as错误同B。</li>
<li>E. includes错误同D；which从句中犯了run-on sentence错误，it应该删去。</li>
