    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>主语letters,有两个动词 be written和outnumber在作谓语和分词作定从或状从之间变来变去。划线前面是letters to 一个人，划线后面letters to anyone else，引申到outnumber有联系两个量作比较的意义，所以快的做法就是根据outnumber才是主句的谓语动词，在BE中选E.</p>
<p>如果没看出来，就读每个选项。</p>
<p>A的outnumbering在这里，就变成定语从句修饰某个名词（a period/the year 1886/the letters to Dickinson），指代不清；或变成状语从句修饰letters were written, 写信这个动作如何能outnumber？写信这个动作的number是什么？本身状从就错了。考虑定从和状从存在两种可能，也错。不优选。</p>
<p>B were written 和 outnumber双谓语</p>
<p>C <span>beginning...and that ends... 不对称，and outnumbering这样写语法上只能和beginning对称修饰a period, a period的number是什么？如何outnumber?</span></p>
<p><span>D <span>beginning, ending, and outnumbering三者平行对称，修饰a period。错因同C。</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>E beginning and ending 平行对称，outnumber是主句谓语动词，正确。<br></span></span></p></div>
