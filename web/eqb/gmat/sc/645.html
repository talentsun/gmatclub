    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点:平行对称(Parallelism) 简洁有效(Rhetorical Construction) 习惯用语(Idiom)</p>
<p>　　1) 结构的平行,句子意思的平行</p>
<p>　　2) 一般来说用复杂的介词短语来做修饰语不如定语从句表达有效.</p>
<p>　　3) both…and…习惯搭配, both…as well as表达错误</p>
<p>　　(A) both…and结构不平行,应该改为at both college and graduate level或both at college and at graduate level; but also连接的前后两个句子从意思上无法平行.</p>
<p>　　(B) both…and结构不平行,应该改为for both college and graduate-level…或both for college and for graduate-level…; but分句中,it只能指代1998,因此but分句中的重心是1998这个年份,而but前的分句: In 1998 several new ventures were…句子重心在ventures,因此从意思上前后分句不平行; 用for + n结构来修饰year,表达笨拙,不如when从句修饰year清晰.</p>
<p>　　(C) both…and结构不平行. 使用with结构改变了原句的逻辑关系,把两个并列成分变为了主从成分;had begun使用过去完成时没有依据.</p>
<p>　　(D) 正确, 使用两个分句进行对比意思表达清晰;it指代1998,并且两个句子的重心都是1998,两个分句意思上也平行;both…and…结构平行;when从句修饰year表达清晰.</p>
<p>　　(E) both…and…固定搭配使用错误;两个分句的重心不一致,导致意思不平行;for结构修饰year不如when引导的定语从句修饰year表达清晰.</p>
<p>　　句子结构:Although 1998 saw…, it was also a year when…</p></div>
