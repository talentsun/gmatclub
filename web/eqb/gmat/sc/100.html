    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>D is incorrect because it uses “as” to compare two nouns: “the planets” and “the stars.” E is incorrect because “some of which at tremendous speeds are in motion” is convoluted and, as a relative clause, refers to “planets” instead of “stars,” changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
<p>This leaves answer choice <b>B. </b>B is correct because “like” is used to compare two nouns: “planets” and “stars.” “Some of them at tremendous speeds” now correctly acts as an absolute phrase, modifying the entire clause “the stars are in motion.” In addition, we have an independent clause after the comma + “but.” Although it may seem that the pronoun “they” is ambiguous and could refer to either the “planets” or the “stars,” the reference is actually clear because the subject of this sentence is “stars” and the whole sentence is about stars.  Planets are just a kind of “throw-away” comparison here.</p></div>
