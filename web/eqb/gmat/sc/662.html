    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点:逻辑表达(Logical Predication) 平行对称(Parallelism)、指代一致(Agreement)</p>
<p>　　1) 指代歧意</p>
<p>　　2) 同一个句子中，连词连接的结构一定是平行结构</p>
<p>　　(A) 第一个they没有可以指代的对象,第二个they可能跟第一个they指代相同,或者指代wagons,导致指代不清;they作为developed的逻辑主语,错误,wagons才是developed的逻辑主语.</p>
<p>　　(B) they 没有指代对象;they作为developed的逻辑主语,应该是wagons作为developed的逻辑主语; and floors curved upward on their ends so that they prevented表达笨拙,their可能指代floors或者wagons,指代不清.they可能跟their指代一致,也可能指代floors,同样指代不清.</p>
<p>　　(C) with high wheels…and had a floor结构不平行,前者是介词结构,后者是动词结构</p>
<p>　　(D) 正确, Conestoga wagons作为developed的逻辑主语,意思正确; wagons had high wheels… and a floor结构平行;that限定性定语从句修饰floor没有歧意;用 to prevent表示目的,简洁,明了.</p>
<p>　　E it没有指代,their指代不清,即可能指代floors也可能指代wagons;句子结构: Developed by Pennsylvania’s Palatine…, Conestoga wagons had high wheels capable of corssing A,B,and C, and a floor that…</p>
<p>　　补充说明:一般来说,当一个代词可以指代多个对象时,它优先指代离它较近代的对象,如果就近指代会导致逻辑 意思的错误,则可以肯定该选项犯有指代不清的错误.(目前GMAT题目均符合该规律) 有and出现的时候,一定要警惕是不是会有平行结构的考点.读选项时,重点读and连接的对象,跳过修饰 语等成分,如果and连接对象不平行,则可以直接排除该选项,节省时间</p></div>
