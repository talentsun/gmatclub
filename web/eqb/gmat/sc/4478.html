<div class="question" id="question_4478">
    A think-tank in Michigan has announced a controversial new finding. It concludes that efforts to combat high emissions from cars by taxing gasoline and SUVs are misplaced; rather, governments should be providing consumers with tax incentives to purchase large cars and carpooling with their neighbors to work.
