<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>句子结构，平行结构</h4>

<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. outnumbering无论做伴随还是结果逻辑意思都是扭曲的。</li>
<li>B. end与begin并列，end时态不正确；outnumber没有主语。</li>
<li>C. and that 没有并列对象，结构不平行; outnumbering 与beginning并列逻辑不合理;</li>

<li>D. and outnumbering与beginning和ending平行逻辑意思不合理；而且句中缺少letters的谓语动词;</li>
<li>E. Correct。</li>
