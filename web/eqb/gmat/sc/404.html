<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：so many people have been moving … that the Mormons, who…, now account for </span>

</h3>
<p>Who非限定性定语从句作为插入语，审题时两个逗号间的部分可以暂时拿掉</p>

<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>固定搭配，平行对称</h4>
<ol><li> 关于so…that…与such…that…(1) such…that表达的是强调含义，与so…that的含义不同(prep 1-131)。<br>(2) so…that后面不加情态动词表示结果，后面加情态动词表目的。<br>(3) so…that不能修饰介词短语与名词，只能修饰动作。<br>(4) so…that用来说明做某事的目的，所以其前面应该是"做某事"，而不能是介词短语。(GWD-30-170)<br>(5) such + adj. + that错误，such必须修饰名词，可以是such+adj.+noun.+that。这里such表示of a kind。</li>
<li>such that连用时的用法：</li>

</ol><p>(1) A rule of correspondence between two sets <span style="font-weight: bold;">such that</span> there is a unique element in the second set assigned to each element in the first set.  (such向前指代a rule of … sets )</p>

<p>函数两组元素一一对应的规则，第一组中的每个元素在第二组中只有唯一的对应量</p>
<p>(2) Her interest with him is <span style="font-weight: bold;">such that</span> she governs him absolutely. (such指代her interest)</p>
<p>她对他的影响非常大，以至于完全控制了他。</p>
<p>(3) The format of the meeting was <span style="font-weight: bold;">such that</span> everyone could ask a question.  (such指代the format of the meeting) 会议安排好可让每个人都能提一个问题。</p>

<p>(4) choose x and y such that x + y = 10 (such向前指代x and y)</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>(A) so和such that混用，so…such that错误；Mormons who were once 75 percent of the population中谓语动词使用错误，Mormons不是一个人数，所以谓语动词不能用were，而应该用represented；account用一般现在时表示某种事实，用进行时没有必要，反而累赘；it指代的不是population，而是整个名词短语75 percent of the population，错误。</li>
<li>(B) 同位语前面需要逗号隔开：Mormons once 75 percent of the population are应该改为Mormons, once 75 percent of the population, are，但是同时用人口数量(once 75 percent of the population)来同位修饰人(Mormons)，概念上不能合理修饰；are now only accounting现在进行时没有必要；only account for half逻辑意思错误，only要紧跟修饰的词，并向后修饰，所以应该放在half前面；用so…来表示因果关系不合理，应该用用so…that…来强调结果；</li>
<li>(C) that引导的名词性从句做主语，是的逻辑含义不合理，而主谓不一致：that…are now accounting for only half of it，也即that出现在句首ungrammatical；such that中的such指代对象是many people还是Utah不清；Mormons that were once 75 percent of the population，摩门教徒=人口数，逻辑含义错误；关系代词that不能指代人，要用who，同时不应该使用限定性修饰，且that were wordy；are now only accounting现在进行时没有必要；it指代的不是population，而是整个名词短语75 percent of the population，错误。</li>
<li>(D) such that使用错误同C；only位置错误同B；run-on sentence，句子有两个谓语动词：have been与account.</li>
<li>(E) Correct；once represented和now account对应，75 percent of the population与only half对应。</li>
