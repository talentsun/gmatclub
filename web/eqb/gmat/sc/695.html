    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 逻辑表达(Logical Predication) 简洁有效(Rhetorical Construction)</p>
<p>　　1) 动词的现在分词作形容词,一般含有正在进行的意思</p>
<p>　　2) which/it 都不能指代整个句子</p>
<p>　　(A) sb. suffer from B,表示sb.遭受了B, B表示的是遭受的结果,因此使用dwindling不好,现在分词一般表示过程, 应该使用名词或过去分词表示结果; 同样increasing也不好, result from后面接事实,表示原因, 应该用increased或者an increase来代替increasing</p>
<p>　　(B) 正确。</p>
<p>　　(C) because of food supplies强调的是food supplies, 而从逻辑上应该强调dwindle; increasing不好,应该用increased或者an increase来表示结果</p>
<p>　　(D) revealed creature of the seabed强调的是名词creature of the seabed, 不能准确的表达revealed的完整意思</p>
<p>　　(E) 除了D中的错误外, which不能指代整个句子,使用错;increasing使用错误</p>
<p>　　句子结构: A study… revealed that creatures… were suffering because…</p></div>
