    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 平行对称(Parallelism) 有效用词(Diction) 简洁有效(Rhetorical Construction)</p>
<p>　　1) 在GMAT考试用只能用whether表示“是否“,不能用if</p>
<p>　　2) when不能够引导条件从句</p>
<p>　　3) 习惯用语:in depth</p>
<p>　　(A) if应该改成whether;使用when从句来表示条件从句,错误</p>
<p>　　(B) if应该改为whether; with as much depth不符合习惯用法</p>
<p>　　(C) It is unclear whether… or would…结构不平行</p>
<p>　　(D) similar patterns would be exhibited in other animals表达笨拙,应该改为主动语态;with as much depth不符合习惯用法;用that限定性定语从句修饰animals无法表达出条件关系,改变了句子的合理意思 大仙注释：其实就是尊重前半截即可，前半截用主动</p>
<p>　　(E) 正确, It is unclear whether… or whether…结构平行;用语简洁,符合习惯用法;使用if从句表达条件关系,符合句子的逻辑意思</p>
<p>　　句子结构: It is unclear whether…, or whether</p>
<p>　　补充说明:GMAT考试中经常会使用when从句来作为条件从句的迷惑选项.对于中国考生来讲比较有迷惑 性,when的意思是"当…的时候",很多人习惯性的省略掉"…的时候"把when理解为"当…"这样一来就容 易把when和if等条件从句弄混.</p>
<p>　　以OG11th 第8题为例:</p>
<p>　　"8.
