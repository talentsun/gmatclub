    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>* "have a disinclination to recognize" is wordy/unidiomatic, and is definitely inferior to "are disinclined to recognize".<br><br>* if you're going to use "while" with an adjective phrase (<span>while willing to...</span>), then that adjective phrase should <span>precede</span> the main verb.<br>i.e., <span>many people, while willing to... , are disinclined to...</span><br><br>* there's also a slight change in meaning.<br>"recognize that their ... skills are weak" just means that the people should know that they have weak skills.<br>"recognize the weakness..." means that they should actually be able to point out the specific weakness.</p></div>
