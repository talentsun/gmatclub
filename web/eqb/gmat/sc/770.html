    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>句子结构：Three out of every four… owners… own a bicycle.</p>
<p>OG10解释：</p>
<p>A, the best choice, is concise, idiomatic, and maintains subject-verb agreement.</p>
<p>In B, Out of every four, three is unidiomatic. The singular verb owns does not agree with its plural subject, three ... owners.</p>
<p>The passive construction in C (Bicycles are owned by) is cumbersome and does not contribute " meaningfully to the sentence. The shift to plural Bicycles detracts from clarity by suggesting that multiple bicycles are owned by each person in question.</p>
<p>In D, the singular owns does not agree with its plural subject three... owners. Furthermore, the " plural bicycles detracts from clarity by suggesting that multiple bicycles are owned by each person in question.</p>
<p>In E, the phrase beginning Out of every four ... cannot properly modify bicycles, and the passive construction (bicycles are also owned) is awkward and does not contribute meaningfully to the sentence. The plural nouns bicycles and automobiles suggest imprecisely that each person owns more than one of each.</p>
