<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>句子结构（grammatical construction）</h4>

<ol><li> 虚拟语气：虚拟条件句的四种形式：<br>But for N, S + should/would/cold/might + V / (have Vpp.) 若不是N, S应该….<br> = If it were not / (had not been) for N<br> =<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Were it not for N / (Had it not been for N)</span></li>

<br> = Without N（介词只有without可表虚拟语气）<br><li> 虚拟语气的时态：</li>

</ol><tr><td>时间</td> <td> 从句谓语形式</td> <td> 主句谓语形式</td>

</tr><br><tr><td>将来</td> <td> 动词过去式(be用were)[br]should + 动词原形[br]were to + 动词原形</td> <td> would / should / might / could + 动词原形</td>

</tr><br><tr><td>现在</td> <td> 动词过去式(be 用 were) </td> <td> would / should / might / could + 动词原形</td>

</tr><br><tr><td>过去</td> <td> had +动词过去分词</td> <td> would / should / might / could have + 动词过去分词</td>

</tr><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">（From Manhattan）if a possessive pronoun PRECEDES a possessive noun, then the assumption is that it DOESN'T stand for that noun.</span> <br><p>simple example:  <span style="font-style: italic;">his mother talked with joe's father.</span> </p>

<p>in this sentence, the implication is that <span style="font-style: italic;">someone else's</span> mother - i.e., NOT joe's mother - talked to joe's father. if it were joe's mother, then the sentence would be written, much more naturally, as <span style="font-style: italic;">joe's mother talked with his father.</span></p>

<br><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. 前面it指代后面主句的主语，成了指代its own weight，错误；这样的虚拟语气句子，主句必须一开头就是主语，而不能是连词、副词，因此instead错误；its指代不清。</li>

<li>B. Instead错误同A；本句子描述的是当下的一个假设情形下的一个假设结果，要用现在时态，用would have collapsed表示了"与过去相反(也就是表示过去没崩溃)"不对。</li>
<li>C. Would have to be collapsing虚拟语气的时态用法错误。</li>
<li>D. correct。</li>

<li>E. it指代了its own weight，错误；its指代不清；would have caused错误同B。</li>
</ul></div>
