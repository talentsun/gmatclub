    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>看完A感觉还行 句子的意思也很清楚 再看B就差远了 动词在如此后面有头重脚轻的感觉 C的意思和前面不同 意思上变成了展示了ocean currents, their patterns and the causes of them 意思上来说应该ocean currents这个没必须揭示吧 虽然这个选项看过去很平行 但意思上稍微有点不够合理 D这种表达明显WORDY 而E的时态有问题 怎么会出现HAD呢 所以只有A相对更好些</p>

<ol><li>a reasonably clear picture has emerged of the patterns and causes of ocean currents属于倒装，把修饰picture的定语of the patterns and causes of ocean currents后置了，迷惑性较大，正常语序应该是：a reasonably clear picture of the patterns and causes of ocean currents has emerged。如果考题这么写，相信很多人都不会错。</li>
<li>对于E，there had emerged，没有这种表达</li>
