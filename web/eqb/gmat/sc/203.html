    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：The direction in which … planets spin was determined by…</p>
<p>　　主句主语是direction，由which引导定语从句修饰，从句主语是the Earth and other solid planets，所以从句谓语用复数spin，主句谓语是被动语态was determined。</p>
<p>　　OG10解释：</p>
<p>　　D, the best choice, is clear and concise, and uses correct subject-verb agreement.</p>
<p>　　Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they use the singular verb spins for the plural subject Earth and the other solid planets--Mercury, Venus, and Mars.</p>
<p>　　Choices A and B furthermore incorrectly use the plural were, which does not agree with the singular subject The direction. To express cause, determined by is idiomatic; the prepositions from and through in A and C are not idiomatic. The phrase determined because of in B is redundant.</p>
<p>　　In E, the phrase determined as a result of is redundant, awkward, and unidiomatic.</p>
<p>　　OG11解释：</p>
<p>　　Agreement + Idiom</p>
<p>　　Two verbs collide in the underlined section, and both have agreement errors. Spins should be plural to agree with its subject the Earth and the other solid planets; were determined should be singular to agree with its subject the direction. The idiom determined by is used to express cause; determined from is incorrect in this context.</p>
<p>　　A Spins should be spin; were should he was; from should be by</p>
<p>　　B Spins should be spin; were should be was; because of should be by</p>
<p>　　C Spins should be spin; through should be by</p>
<p>　　D Correct. In this sentence, spin agrees with the plural subject the Earth and the other solid planets; was determined agrees with its subject the direction; the idiom determined by is used to express cause.</p>
<p>　　E The wordy as a result of is not the correct idiom</p></div>
