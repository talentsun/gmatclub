    In late 1997, the chambers inside the pyramid of the Pharaoh Menkaure at Giza were closed to visitors for cleaning and repair <span style="text-decoration:underline;">due to moisture exhaled by tourists, which raised its humidity to such levels so that salt from the stone was crystallizing</span> and fungus was growing on the walls.

<h3>考点</h3>

<ol><li> Because of 后只能加简单的名词结构，because of sb's doing 一定要改成because这种情况同样适用于due to， despite（in despite of）， as a result of</li>

<li> 代词指代</li>
<li> Such/so…that固定搭配。Such … so that搭配错误。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. due to moisture无法表达closed for cleaning and repair的直接原因；用which引导非限定性定从不能表达出该有的意思；such…so that固定习语使用错误；its无所指代。</li>

<li>B. due to moisture无法表达closed for cleaning and repair的直接原因。thereby raising用法awkward；its无所指；such that + would(情态动词)是表达目的，逻辑含义错误；stone would crystallize和fungus was growing on the walls不平行。</li>
<li>C. tourists were exhaling moisture无法表达closed for cleaning and repair的直接原因；Which在GMAT里面不可以指代前面整个分句（至今没有一道官方题目有which指代前面整句）；Such that + would(情态动词)是表达目的，逻辑含义错误；them指代了tourists错误；stone would crystallize和fungus was growing on the walls不平行。</li>

<li>D. because of moisture无法表达closed for cleaning and repair的直接原因；so … as to make使得与后面的fungus was growing on the walls不平行； that was exhaled没有必要补出that was，累赘。</li>
<li>E. Correct. humidity within them...tourists身体里面不可能包含有humidity，而且by tourists在从句的介宾短语里，是不会被指代的，所以them不会指代混乱。</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<p>根据逻辑含义本题可以迅速得出选项：</p>
<p>首先were closed to visitors for cleaning and repair的原因，只有一个，就是"潮气引发了什么"而使得它需要修理了，只有E表达了这个意思，其他选项，看前三个词，就可以排除。A,B,D表达的是，是因为"潮气"本身，使得他们要修。C表达的是，旅客们呼出潮气，所以他们要修，也是不对的。只有E，表达出了潮气引起了湿度上升。</p></div>
