<div class="question" id="question_90">
    Although early soap operas <span style="text-decoration:underline;">were first aired on evening radio in the 1920s, they had moved to the daytime hours of the 1930s</span> when the evening schedule became crowded with comedians and variety shows.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>首先although后面需要一个完整句 那么可直接排除CD  D是因为他是应该被动的 因为肥皂剧不能自己移动。再根据时态我们可以排除A因为如果用A的had moved的话就说明move这个动作先于aired的了，这从文章来看是不符合逻辑的。E选项于B比起来 首先aired与were moved 不对称 其次B的意思是在1930s 被移动到了早间时段，E的意思是被移动到了1930s的早上。不觉得B好像更符合逻辑一些吗  </p></div>
