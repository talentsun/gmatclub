<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：Fossils……have been dated ……，making……</span>
</h3>
<h3>考点</h3>

<ol><li> 定语从句：限制性定语从句与非限制性定语从句</li>

<li> 主谓一致</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. dated与found都是过去分词，共同修饰fossils，and前面不需要逗号；fossils使得sloth成为earliest known mammal逻辑意思不对，应该是年份鉴定的结果使之成为earliest known mammal；it指代不清楚。</li>
<li>B. that they中的they无指代；that引导的是限制性定语从句，与先行词之间不能加逗号，且当先行词在定语从句中做宾语时关系代词不必补出；has错，fossils是复数名词，应该使用have；it指代不清；主句与伴随状语making it…无因果关系，不应用thus。</li>
<li>C. that was可以省略，且应该用that were；谓语动词应该用复数形式；this无所指。</li>

<li>D. Correct；found修饰fossils；have been dated是句子的谓语部分，主语是fossils，making伴随表结果。</li>

<li>E. 非限制性定语从句前应该加上逗号；定语从句谓语动词形式错误，应该用复数。</li>
