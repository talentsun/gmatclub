<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>逻辑表达( logical prediction)</h4>
<p>习惯搭配：competition from sb./sth.  而competition by sb./sth.错误。</p>

<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. competition from sb/sth；that不能指代整个句子；it指代competition有误。</li>
<li>B. grain-producing state无法同位修饰competition，概念不同；cause用过去进行时错误，好像在说19世纪中叶那段时间cause还没有结束。</li>

<li>C. that不能指代整个句子；it指代有误；前分句被动语态不好，累赘；in the mid-nineteenth century修饰了large western farms错误，应该紧跟competition。</li>
<li>D. it指代competiton不合理；competition from sb/sth；cause用过去进行时错误。</li>

<li>E. Correct。</li>
