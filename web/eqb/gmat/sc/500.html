    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：Fossils of a whale that beached … and was subsequently butchered ... have been recovered ….</span>
</h3>
<p>主语Fossils，谓语have been recovered，that从句修饰whale，其中beached和was subsequently butchered并列</p>
<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>主谓一致 题目释义 平行对称</h4>
<p>现在分词的完成式having done（主动）和having been done（被动）不做后置定语</p>

<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. Correct；。</li>

<li>B. has与主语Fossils不一致；then与subsequently重复。</li>
<li>C. has与主语Fossils不一致；which非限定性修饰whale错误，应该用非限定性修饰。</li>
<li>D. having been beached，现在分词的完成式having done（主动）不做限定性修饰，只能做非限定性修饰。</li>

<li>E. having beached，现在分词的完成式having been done（被动）不做限定性修饰；then与subsequently重复。</li>
</ul></div>
