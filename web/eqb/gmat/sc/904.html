<h3>考点</h3>
<ol><li> Or并列结构前后要平行对称</li>

<li> 动词优于one's doing</li>
<li> 代词指代</li>
<li> through和by的区别：表示"通过做B达成了A（A已经做到）"时倾向于through，表示"通过做B做A(A还在被做)"是倾向用by。</li>

</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Or前后不对称；they无所指，Federal Reserve为单数</li>
<li>B. Its keeping不如keeping简洁有效；their指代错误</li>

<li>C. Correct，or perhaps even前的逗号是强调作用</li>
<li>D. Their指代错误；one's doing不如doing简洁有效；Or前后不对称</li>
<li>E. Their指代错误；one's doing不如doing简洁有效；Or前后不对称；it很突兀，而且没有指代对象</li>
</ul></div>
