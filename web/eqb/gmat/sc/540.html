    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>题目释义：TWEC announced it was …… because of……</h3>

<h3>考点</h3>
<ol><li>时态要（根据句子意思）保持一致</li>

<li>代词指代</li>
<li>固定搭配：account for：to be the reason why something happens</li>
<span style="font-style: italic;">?Recent pressure at work may account for his behavior.</span>

<br><li>announce固定搭配：(1)announce something to somebody 或者 announce to somebody something (相当于宾语后置)<br>(2)announce a decision/intention/plan (在这个时候如果plan等后面接to do不会产生to do做状语修饰announce的歧义)*:The government has announced plans to create 10,000 new jobs.<br>(3) announce (that)<br>(4)announce somebody/yourself 通报...的到达;通知...已准备好（注意这个短语有专门意思）<br>错误用法：<br>(1)announce to do sth.</li>

<li>句子以简洁有效为美</li>

<li>such that 表达的是强调含义，与so that表达目的（后面加情态动词时）的含义不同：so是副词，一般修饰形容词，such是名词，一般指代前面的名词。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. 时态错误, TWEC announced that since sales……are poor, they will…, announced与are, will时态不一致；此外，they在语法上可以指代sales，但是在逻辑上应该指代its stores，存在歧义，不正确。</li>
<li>B.时态错误，同A。首先，在此which只有指代了前面整句逻辑才合理，但which在GMAT里面无法指代前面整句。其次即便which能指代前面整句，which account for:说明（解释）…的原因，此处将句意变为了"关门是poor sales的原因"，所以不正确。</li>
<li>C.Correct；如果宾语从句引导词that不补出，依然能使正常读者清晰断句，且announce后面常常不补出。</li>
<li>D.announce to do是错的，正确用法是announce sth. to sb或者直接加句子。</li>

<li>E.announce having poor sales累赘，unidiomatic；will时态错误，同A；such that用法错误。</li>
</ul></div>
