    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：Although…, his plays, novels, poems, and travel books, …, remain almost unknown…</p>
<p>　　主语是plays, novels, poems, and travel books，系动词是remain，表语是unknown。that引导定语从句修饰名词fairy tales(状语从句的宾语)。</p>
<p>　　考点：逻辑表达、比较、简洁有效</p>
<p>　　逻辑表达-修饰(定语从句)，限制性与非限制性定语从句的区别(详见补充说明)</p>
<p>　　逻辑表达-合理的句子意思，注意分析原句所要表达的意思，选择适当的连词引导状语从句表达从句与主句之间准确的逻辑关系，本题中注意区分although, even as, while的区别。</p>
<p>　　比较，unlike比较结构的对象要对等。</p>
<p>　　简洁有效，在表达“是最…之一”时用among the most…。</p>
<p>　　(A) 问题出在第二个which。</p>
<p>　　(B) which引导的修饰fairy tales的定语从句缺少谓语动词，while位置错误，应该置于his plays前面。</p>
<p>　　(C) even as所表达的含义与原句不同，even as是“正当，恰好在…时候”，有at the same time的意思，而原句表达的是让步转折含义;将原句定语从句内容fairy tales that…改变为句子谓语’s fairy tales have been…，改变原句强调重心。</p>
<p>　　(D) Unlike的比较对象不对等(the fairy tales与he对比);两个which修饰对象都不清楚;be some of the most…的表达方式不如be among the most…准确。</p>
<p>　　(E) 正确，although引导让步状语从句，其主语是Han Christian Andersen，谓语是wrote，宾语是由that引导的从语从句所修饰的名词fairy tales;整个句子的主语是his plays, novels, poems, and travel books，系动词是remain。</p>
<p>　　补充说明:限定性定语从句、非限定性定语从句 这两种定语从句在其功能和形式方面都有明显的区别： 限定性定语从句与主句的关系很紧凑，对其先行词起限定、修饰的作用。如果将其去掉，会影响句子 意思的完整性;有时甚至于引起费解、误解。</p>
<p>　　例如： Rainforests are being cleared for valuable timber and other resources to speed up the economic growth of the nationsin which they are located .</p>
<p>　　为了加速他们各自所在国家的经济发展，热带雨林" 作为有价值的原木和其他资源正为人们所砍伐。 非限定性定语从句在形式上就与主句很松散，它与主句之间有一个逗点"，"隔开;它对其先行词没有 限定、修饰的作用，只起补充、说明的作用。有时也用它来对全句进行补充、说明。即使将其去掉， 也不会影响句子意思。由于上述原因，非限定性定语从句在表达意思方面也有别于限定性定语从句。 另外，非限定性定语从句在中文译文里，我们往往将其作为一个分句处理，而不把它作定语翻译。</p>
<p>　　例 如： Earlier , the Babylonians had attempted to map the world , but they presented it in the form of a flattened disc rather than a sphere , which was the form adopted by Ptolemy . (此句中，非限定性" 定语从句是对先行词 a sphere 进行补充、说明。)更早之前，巴比伦人曾试图绘制世界地图，但是他 们把它绘制成平盘状而不是托勒密所采用的球体状。</p></div>
