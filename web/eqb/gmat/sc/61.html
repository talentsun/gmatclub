    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>此题的解题关键是找准题目本意是哪什么同埃及的金字塔，玛雅的城市进行比较。既然都是古代辉煌的文明，那自然是用兵马俑本身作为比较对象。</p>
<p>A. 正确，因为兵马俑，埃及金字塔，玛雅古城都是同类事物。</p>
<p>B. 拿秦始皇比较 错误</p>
<p>C. 拿<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><i>70万工匠</i></span>比较，应为时间 it took ... time to do. 错误</p>
<p>D. 拿<i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">年份</span></i>比较，应为工匠，错误 </p>
<p>E. 拿年份比较，错误</p>
<p>（其实题目本身也不是比较题，只是个人认为这样解释会比较好理解一些）</p>
<p>MercuuReal below:</p>
<p>不用读句子，只要找rivaling这个定语从句修饰的对象。rivaling是匹敌的意思，就是比较。这个所修饰的对象（主句主语）必须可以和pyramids匹敌，A主语兵马俑 B主语皇帝 C主语时间 D主语工匠 E主语时间 所以选A。</p></div>
