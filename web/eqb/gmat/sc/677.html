    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 句子结构(Grammatical Construction) 主谓一致(Agreement)</p>
<p>　　1) 两个句子并列,第一个句子含有be动词,第二个句子中的be动词必须省略,同时,一些重复的名词或形容词也必须省略, 但是be功能不同时不能省略.</p>
<p>　　2) 单数复数: the percent of +可数名词复数形式, 谓语动词用复数</p>
<p>　　3) there be + n 句型中, be动词的单复形式由n的单复形式决定</p>
<p>　　4) 伴随状语不能修饰主句系动词</p>
<p>　　(A) 正确, 句子结构简洁; where就近修饰homes, 符合逻辑意思</p>
<p>　　(B) and lighting still provided省略了was, 因为这里was作为助动词,而前一个并列句的was是系动词,功能不同,不能省略.</p>
<p>　　(C) where语法上就近修饰electricity,导致逻辑错误; being多余</p>
<p>　　(D) was应该改为were, 因为one percent of homes是复数名词; having… 修饰对象不清楚。</p>
<p>　　(E) where语法上就近修饰electricity,导致逻辑意思错误;had been过去完成时态错误。</p>
<p>　　句子结构:…, important public places such as… had installed…, but electricty was in…, where lighting was…</p></div>
