    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>此题根据主语及谓语的出现速度排除ＢＤＥ不难　即：一个句子，主语　谓语　这是ＧＭＡＴ中的习惯表达方式　剩下ＡＣ　相对来说Ｃ更好　因为很明显ＳＡ为Ｔｒａｉｎｉｎｇ的发起者</p>

<p>A句的who可以指代最近的名词Artists 可以指代Stella 涉嫌指代不清。语法题不需要读懂句意。B的主句谓语时态是did，从句时态是do 中间跳过一个have done，涉嫌时态跳步。C句的training是定语从句省略引导词的用法，默认指代主句主语。后面的whose指代紧挨前面的名词actors，指代明确，时态没有跳步。　</p></div>
