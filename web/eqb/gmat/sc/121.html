<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>代词指代（reference）平行结构（parallelism）逻辑意思（Logical predication）</h4>

<ol><li>link…with…固定搭配</li>
<li>代词若离其所指代对象太远，则会造成指代不清的情况。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. correct；They是完全指代，指代sales of wines。and particularly of red wine中去掉and也是对的(and可放在插入语前，不影响逻辑—lcy19812000)；begin to do或begin doing都正确；in particular在本题不如particularly有效，因为介词太多句式会复杂。</li>
<li>B. red wine与alcohol consumption概念不同，不能同位修饰，应该在red wine后面也补上consumption；they离其所指代的slaes太远，使得句子理解起来不清晰，awkward；link A with B，A和B谁在前并不要紧。</li>
<li>C. which指代的是red wine，错误；particularly of red wine与moderate alcohol consumption不平行，后者应改为moderate consumption of alcohol；cause的主语是consumption，逻辑意思很荒谬，正确的主语应该是report。</li>

<li>D. with独立主格的核心名词是a reduced risk of heart disease risk，用它来伴随they began growing意思上很荒谬；red wine不能修饰alcohol consumption，要在red wine前面加上of；they began growing中的they离其指代对象sales过远。</li>
<li>E. in a 1991 report错误地修饰了moderate alcohol consumption，好像consumption是发生在report里；in particular red wine无法修饰alcohol consumption，概念不同；link to搭配错误；start的主语是risk错误；start them中的them指代不清。</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<ol><li> OG12-121解释：</li>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical predication; Rhetorical construction</span>
<br>This sentence explains why a trend of declining wine sales reversed after the publication of a 1991 report suggesting that moderate consumption of red wine correlated with reduced risk of heart disease. The phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">particularly of red wine </span>modifies <span style="font-style: italic;">consumption of alcohol</span>, and the sentence must make clear that it is <span style="font-style: italic;">moderate consumption</span>, not <span style="font-style: italic;">red wine </span>that the report links to <span style="font-style: italic;">reduced risk.</span>

<br></ol><ul><li>A.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct. </span>In the second clause, <span style="font-style: italic;">they </span>refers correctly to <span style="font-style: italic;">sales of wines</span>; the relative clause beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">that </span>clearly indicates that the report <span style="font-style: italic;">linked moderate consumption </span>… <span style="font-style: italic;">with a reduced risk.</span></li>



<li>B. <span style="font-style: italic;">Particularly red wine </span>cannot describe consumption—the preposition <span style="font-style: italic;">of </span>is needed; the placement of <span style="font-style: italic;">they </span>so far from the position of the antecedent <span style="font-style: italic;">Sales </span>makes the sentence awkward and difficult to decode.</li>
<li>C.The clause beginning with <span style="font-weight: bold;">which refers to red wine</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>in this construction, erroneously suggesting that wine rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">moderate consumption </span>of alcohol correlates with reduced risk of heart disease; <span style="font-style: italic;">particularly of red wine </span>is not parallel to <span style="font-style: italic;">moderate alcohol consumption</span>; it needs to follow <span style="font-style: italic;">moderate consumption of alcohol </span>to make sense.</li>

<li>D. Without the preposition <span style="font-style: italic;">of</span>, the sentence indicates that red wine is a kind of consumption—which makes no sense.</li>
<li>E. The incorrect placement of the modifier <span style="font-style: italic;">in a 1991 report </span>suggests that wine is being consumed (albeit in moderation) in the report itself.</li>
</ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">The correct answer is A.</span>
<br><li> 本题的秒杀方法：只有A选项but前后才是平行对称的，S.V.O+介词短语做时间状语，but S.V.O.+介词短语做时间状语。如此平行的结构，应该在第一时间对A建立好感。其次再用平行结构确认选项的排除。</li>
