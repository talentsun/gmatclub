    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：What… comes from studies of the cranium, the bony house of…</p>
<p>　　名词从句what scientists know about dinsaur brains作主语，谓语动词是comes，the bony house of…作cranium的同位语，过去分词结构located in the back of the skull作后置定语修饰名词brain。</p>
<p>　　考点：逻辑表达、主谓一致</p>
<p>　　1) 逻辑表达-过去分词结构，过去分词结构如果作定语，一定要尽可能紧临其修饰词，用逗号隔离之后修饰对象可能是邻近的名词，可能是主语，也可能修饰后面的词，也可以做状语。</p>
<p>　　2) 主谓一致，what引导的名词从句作主语，谓语动词用单数形式。</p>
<p>　　(A) which就近指代brain错误;过去分词定语located in…修饰对象不清楚，可能是cranium，也可能是brain;名词从句what scientists know about…作主语，谓语应该用单数comes。</p>
<p>　　(B) The knowledge that scientists know about…表达方式罗嗦;过去分词结构located…修饰对象不清楚;that is指代不清楚。</p>
<p>　　(C) 名词从句作主语，谓语应该用单数comes;which就近指代brain，那么and后面的is called the cranium的主语也是brain，主谓搭配错误。</p>
<p>　　(D) 正确，名词从句作主语，谓语动词用单数comes，the bony house of…是cranium的同位语，二者是相同的事物，过去分词located in the back of the skull修饰名词brain。</p>
<p>　　(E) it和this指代都不清楚;scientists know what they know about表达不清晰。</p></div>
