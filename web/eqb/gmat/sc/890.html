    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　A. this不能用于指代前句描述的事情;assist习语搭配不正确;distinguish their own species from that of others中，that of多余。One species and others, others即为other species，不再需要that指代</p>
<p>　　B. this不能用于指代前句描述的事情;species为单数，复数的those没有指代对象，即使改为that，如A选项分析，也不正确</p>
<p>　　C. which不能用于指代前句描述的事情，没有指代对象;in being able to罗嗦</p>
<p>　　D. assist习语搭配不正确;选项改变了原句的动宾关系：to taste作assist的宾语，to distinguish作taste的宾语，完全改变了句子意思;those没有指代对象，即使改为that，也不正确</p>
<p>　　E. 正确</p>
<p>　　句子结构：Hydrocarbons are known to be important in courtship, apparently assisting…. 现在分词作伴随状语。</p>
<p>　　考点:习惯用语(Idiom), 指代一致(Agreement)assist正确的习语搭配为：assist (somebody) with/in something, assist in doing somethingwhich、this不能用于指代前句描述的事情</p></div>
