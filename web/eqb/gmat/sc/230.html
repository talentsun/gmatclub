    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 主谓一致(Agreement) 比较(Comparison)、动词形式(Verb Form)</p>
<p>　　1) 主谓一致: 复合主语A and B的谓语动词要用复数</p>
<p>　　2) 比较的对象要概念对等</p>
<p>　　(A) was和复合主语style and his choices…主谓不一致; it没有指代对象</p>
<p>　　(B) 正确, were as disturbing to his own time as they are compelling for ours表明是过去的情况和现在的情况相对比, 符合逻辑意思; 比较双方概念对等,两个句子powerful style and his choices were disturbing to his own time和they are compelling for ours进行比较</p>
<p>　　(C) in his own time表明应该用过去的某一个时态,因此has been现在完成时使用错误</p>
<p>　　(D) it没有指代; was使用错误,应该使用现在时are表明是过去跟现在相比(his own time… ours)</p>
<p>　　(E) 现在完成时错误; 该比较结构是句子跟句子进行比较, as compelling for ours不是句子, 因此比较的对象概念不对等</p>
<p>　　句子结构: Thomas Eakin’s powerful style and his choices… were as … as…</p></div>
