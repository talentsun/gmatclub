    According to one expert, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the cause of genetic irregularities in many breeds of dog is not so much that dogs are being bred for looks or to meet other narrow criteria</span> as that the breeds have relatively few founding members.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：According to…, the cause of… is not so much that… as that… 比较结构。</p>
<p>　　考点：比较、平行对称</p>
<p>　　1) 比较的习惯用法，not so much that… as that… 与其说…不如说…，形式平行，常见的错误用法有：not so much their…as much as that; not so as…as much as; not so much… so much as，且前后不平行。</p>
<p>　　2) 平行对称，GMAT语法中常见的平行结构混淆选项是形式上平行，但逻辑上修饰对象是错误的，要从逻辑意思出发，看平行对象是否合理。</p>
<p>　　(A) 正确，for looks or to meet平行修饰谓语bred，是功能平行而不是形式平行，表示be bred的目的。</p>
<p>　　(B) not so much their being…as much as that…不平行。</p>
<p>　　(C) it表语从句用法错误，not so much the cause of…as much as that…不平行;are being bred for looks or meeting…中的meeting有与being并列的歧义，应该用to meet表示目的。</p>
<p>　　(D) it表语从句用法错误，第二个is多余，not so much… so much as搭配错误;应该用to meet。</p>
<p>　　(E) it表语从句用法错误;to be bred和to meet逻辑上不平行;not so much that…搭配不完整。</p></div>
