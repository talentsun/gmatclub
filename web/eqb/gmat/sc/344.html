    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A，finding逻辑主语不对</li>
<li>B，an investigation ... have 主谓单复数不一致</li>
<li>C，是唯一平行对称的，found that…,that…,that…</li>
<li>D，改变了句子的重心</li>
<li>E，found that ... ,that..., with 不平行</li>
</ul><h3>考点</h3>
<p>平行对称，对于这种很长或者全画线的题目，前三后三的方法是不适用了，这种题目往往需要改变句子的结构，或者变换修饰语的位置，做题的时候就是一个个地读，往往读地最清楚，意思最明白的那个就是正确答案。</p></div>
