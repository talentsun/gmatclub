    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：Even though…, the state’ attorney general accused the bank of engaging in… by failing to…</p>
<p>　　主语是attorney，谓语是accused，宾语是the bank，of engaging in…是介词短语作宾语补语。</p>
<p>　　考点：简洁有效、习惯用法</p>
<p>　　<span style="background-color: #ff0;">简洁有效，当because of, by doing, because, due to, by + 名词等在选项句首，第一选择是because连词，其次是by doing，因为动词比名词更能表达的意思更完整。</span></p>
<p>　　习惯用法，<span style="background-color: #ff0;">promise to do sth或者promise that</span>…</p>
<p>　　(A) 正确，by doing to do表示engage in deceptive business practice的方式;promise的习惯用法是promise to do sth或者promise that…，而不是promise of doing 或in doing sth。</p>
<p>　　(B) 名词failure不如动词failing简洁。</p>
<p>　　(C) its failing是动名词不够简洁;promise of doing的表达不正确。</p>
<p>　　(D) 名词failure不如动词failing简洁。</p>
<p>　　(E) its failing是动名词不够简洁;promise of doing的表达不正确</p></div>
