    Although various eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American poets had professed an interest in Native American poetry and had pretended to imitate Native American forms in their own works, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">until almost 1900, scholars and critics did not begin seriously to study</span> traditional Native American poetry in native languages.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>划线前面是一个完整的although从句，从句的主句清晰，所以要看的是代词，有一个their指代主语poets.到划线后面是宾语和介词所以不用看。纵向比较选项，C最特别是not until... were S&amp;C to begin 倒装还原为 S&amp;C were not to begin until... 这个were to结构不优选。ABDE的不同还有begin to do 和begin doing。to do 表示发生的时候不确定，doing表示发生的时候已经确定了。D项那个when从句使主句变成孤零零的 it was not almost until 1900.什么也没说，指代不清,排除。E项是强调句式 it was... that... 而且begin studying 说的是到了almost 1900这个时间就做了，由于1900这个时间是过去式了，所以用doing表示study这个动作的确定性，正确。B项在1900前没begun(had not begun所谓的“完成时”实际上had not begun指这个动作发生在began或did not begin之前)却用了studying表示什么确定？A的until却用了did，好像比不上用完成时的。</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>OG解释</p>
<p>The past-perfect verbs <span style="background-color: #ff0;">had professed </span>and<span style="background-color: #ff0;"> had pretended </span>designate a time (eighteenth and nineteenth century) earlier than simple past tense, so the second clause, explaining what happened around 1900, must use the past tense. The placement of the phrase <span style="background-color: #ff0;">until almost 1900</span> at the beginning of the second clause is confusing. Does it refer back to the fi rst verb or forward to the next verb?</p>
<p><b>A</b> The tenses are fi ne in this version, but the placement of <span style="background-color: #ff0;">until almost 1900</span> is problematic.<br><b>B</b> The tense of the second clause needs to be simple past, not past perfect.<br><b>C </b>The sequence of infi nitives (<span style="background-color: #ff0;">to begin seriously to study</span>) is awkward and wordy.<br><b>D</b> <span style="background-color: #ff0;">Not almost until</span> is a nonsensical sequence of modifi ers.<br><b>E</b> Correct. The phrase <span style="background-color: #ff0;">not until almost 1900 </span>is properly placed, and the verb in the main clause is in the simple past tense.<br><b>The correct answer is E.</b></p></div>
