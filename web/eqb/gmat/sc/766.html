    The rise of the Incan empire rested not only on the Incas' military might and the ability of their rulers but also <span style="text-decoration:underline;">they imposed a highly organized economic and political system on many different ethnic groups and permitting them</span> to retain many of their customs and often their own leaders.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>句子结构：The rise of… rested not only on… but also on… 并列结构。</p>
<p>考点：平行对称、句子结构 平行对称-介词短语，not only, but also连接的平行对称必须形式对等。 句子结构，GMAT中，常有从句的内容在语法上与主句结构并列的错误，出现连词and时，要注意 其连接的对象是否在形式上对称，是否在逻辑上平行。</p>
<p>(A) Not only, but also连接对象不平行，前面是介词短语，后面是句子；and permitting没有并列对象。</p>
<p>(B) 正确，not only on… but also on…介词短语平行；who引导从句修饰名词groups。</p>
<p>(C) Not only, but also连接对象不平行；because of与rest on有语意上的重复；从句中who与they两个 主语重复。</p>
<p>(D) Not only, but also 连接对象不平行，one's+动名词不如直接用名词形式；and they permitted 没有 并列对象。</p>
<p>(E) Not only, but also连接对象不平行，前面是介词短语，后面是现在分词结构；句尾的分词结构 permitting…修饰对象不清楚，有作伴随状语的歧义。</p></div>
