    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　A. the ability为单数主语，要求谓语为has;accurate修饰ability，形容词搭配不合理。此外，like不能用于举例，应该使用such as</p>
<p>　　B. accurate修饰ability，形容词搭配不合理</p>
<p>　　C. 正确</p>
<p>　　D. accurate修饰ability，形容词搭配不合理;like不能用于举例，应该使用such as</p>
<p>　　E. the ability为单数主语，要求谓语动词也为单数has become;accurate修饰ability，形容词搭配不合理;like不能用于举例，应该使用such as</p>
<p>　　句子结构：Scientists have become able to provide….为主结构。 ever more accurate models作为provide的宾语。of 引起的介宾短语修饰models，responses作介词" of的宾语。to引起介宾短语又进一步修饰responses，并且用到了such as结构进行举例。</p>
<p>　　考点:逻辑表达(Logical Predication), 主谓一致(Agreement), 有效用词(Diction) 精确的(accurate)一词合理的修饰对象是什么?我们可以说精确的模型(models)、数据(figure) 等，但是不能说精确的能力(ability)the ability为单数主语，要求谓语动词也为单数like不能用于表示举例，GMAT中举例要求使用such as</p></div>
