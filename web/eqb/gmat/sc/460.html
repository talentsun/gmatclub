    All Y chromosomes in existence today are descended from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">a single ancestor's who is thought to have lived</span> about 140,000 years ago.

    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_460" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Y chromosomes are descended from后面肯定是接Y chromosomes或a single ancestor's（省略Y chromosome），由此排除C</p>
<p><span><span>who不可指代ancestor's排除AB<br></span></span></p>
<p><span>a single ancestor 在<span>thought to have lived/<span>it was thought had lived</span>中做have lived/had lived的主语，所以代词应该用who而不是whom，排除C</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>故答案为D</span></span></p>
