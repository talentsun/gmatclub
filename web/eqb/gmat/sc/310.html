    Proponents of artificial intelligence say they will be able to make computers that can understand English and other human languages,recognize objects, and reason <span style="text-decoration:underline;">as an expert does-computers that will be used to diagnose equipment breakdowns, deciding whether to authorize a loan or other purposes such as these</span>.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>首先看完A应该明确这是一个一致性的考题 understand English and other human languages 还有recognize objects, 和reason 这三个一致 还有就是<span>diagnose equipment breakdowns 和<span>deciding whether to authorize a loan or other purposes such as these</span>. 两者需要一致 这题而且选项比较长 所以要抓住这个点快速扫选项 发现AE不行 而且E的句意乱死了 再看B中which 指谁 which 就近指代名词 C还行 D like the diagnosis of 对于like 而言就是一个像的意思 举例肯定要胜such as </span></p></div>
