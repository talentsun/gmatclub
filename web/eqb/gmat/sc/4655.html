<div class="question" id="question_4655">
    In an effort to shorten the time span and cut the costs needed to grow full size beef stock, many ranchers substitute cornmeal and ground bones <span style="text-decoration:underline;">for their cattle's regular diet, branded by them</span> to become generic-grade beef.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Choice C, which makes use of a present participle, implies that the ranchers themselves have been branded to become generic-grade beef. (I wonder how that would taste?) <br><br>Choice B would probably be a little better with 'that' instead of 'which', but the clause is essential (so it shouldn't have the commas). You know the clause is essential because not ALL of the cattle are branded to become generic-grade beef; therefore, the clause refers only to those cattle that ARE destined to that fate.</p></div>
