    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 有效用词(Diction)… 平行对称(Parallelism)…逻辑表达(Logical Predication)…习惯用语(Idiom)</p>
<p>　　1) 习惯用法:as…as; more…than</p>
<p>　　2) GMAT考试中经常出现将相等比较as...as和more...than...形式比较合并在一起写的错误或者故意复杂化的表示方法;正确表达应该是:as least as great as或者as great as or greater than</p>
<p>　　3) 并列句主语相同,应该省略重复的主语</p>
<p>　　4) 在没有明显时间证据的情况下,并列成分尽量使用同一个时态</p>
<p>　　(A) 从逻辑上看conclude这个动作应该和found这个动作构成因果关系的,平等的两个动作,而不应该构成主要和次要成分,因此 therefore concluding应该改为and therefore have concluded结构跟主句中的have found构成平等的成分; its指代不清,上一个分句中存在多个单数名词moving water, surface; as …than结构不符合习惯用法</p>
<p>　　(B) 错误同A; as much water or more as表达不正确</p>
<p>　　(C) 正确，Scientists have found…and have therefore concluded结构平行; planet’s crust消除了its的指代模糊; three times as much as符合习惯用法</p>
<p>　　(D) its指代不清; as much water, or more, than表达不正确; they重复,应该去掉</p>
<p>　　(E) 没有时间证据,concluded应该改为现在完成时,跟前一个并列成分使用同一个时态; three times more water as表达不正确</p>
<p>　　句子结构: Scientists have found…and have therefore concluded that…</p></div>
