<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>比较结构</h4>
<h4>1)关于economic和economical</h4>
<p>economic 是"经济上的"，economical是"节约的"。</p>
<ol><li>economic [only before noun]PE relating to trade, industry, and the management of money</li>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Economic growth is slow.<br>the government's economic policy<br>Economic reform is needed.<br>In the current economic climate (=conditions), we must keep costs down</span>

<br><li>economical =cheap or not wasteful.</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>(A) a great deal与now比较(than后面只有一个成分now，所以a great deal只有与其进行对比)，概念不对等?now作为状语没有与其平行的副词，所以than后面需要有成分能够与a great deal平行，一个好的解决方法是than后面补出主谓，使than前后形成句子的平行，补出谓语的原因是使比较对象没有歧义。</li>
<li>(B) economic的意思是：relating to trade, industry, and the management of money，而economical为便宜or节省的意思，根据逻辑含义应该用economic。</li>
<li>(C) economical使用错误。</li>
<li>(D) Correct；本句使用would have to还是have to都可以(详见补充说明)。</li>

<li>(E) a great deal与now比较，概念不对等 。</li>

</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<p>would have to know是不很肯定的语气，其表达的是have to do的内容只是一个假设，并不是真的"必须"，而have to表达的意思是，要做的事情非常重要，"必须"去做。在本题中两种含义都合理，因此没有必要做这样的区分。</p>
