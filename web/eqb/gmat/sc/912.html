<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>比较（comparison）</h4>
<ol><li> 比较对象要对等。</li>
<li> 夹心修饰。</li>
<li> 时态--现在完成时。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. 比较对象是Bartók和Schoenberg's twelve-tone system，不对等。</li>
<li>B. 比较对象是Bartók和Schoenberg and his twelve-tone system比较，不对等；关系代词which只能引导非限定性定语从句，且which指代了"Schoenberg and his twelve-tone system"错误。</li>

<li>C. correct。比较对象是Bartók和Schoenberg's。</li>
<li>D. 比较对象是Bartók和the twelve-tone system，不对等；现在完成时表示了system现今仍然在dominate music，逻辑错误。</li>
<li>E. 比较错误同B，不对等；dominating是"squinting modifier"修饰对象不明，既可以向前修饰Schoenberg and the twelve-tone system，也可以向后修饰Bartók。</li>

<li>OG11-95的解释：Comparison + Modification<br>The original sentence makes the logical error of comparing Bartok to the 12-tone system. The lack of clarity results in the implication that the system might have founded a school or left behind disciples. The sentence must clearly indicate that it is the individuals, Bartok and Schoenberg, who are being compared. It must also make it plain that it was the system that dominated the music of the postwar period.</li>
</ol><ul><li>A. Illogically compares Bartok to the 12-tone system, rather than to Schoenberg</li>
<li>B. Incorrect use of and illogically compares Bartok to the system; incorrect pronoun use</li>
<li>C. Correct. This sentence makes the logical comparison between the individuals, and the relative clause clarifies that it is the system that dominated the music of the postwar period.</li>
<li>D. Illogically compares Bartok to the system, rather than to Schoenberg, perfect verb form has dominated distorts the meaning by indicating that the system continues to dominate music today</li>
<li>E. Incorrect use of and illogically compares Bartok to the system as well as Schoenberg; introduces confusion about what dominating modifies</li>
</ul><p>The correct answer is C.</p>

<li>OG10中解释(菜鸟手册第245题)</li>


<p>C, the best answer, is the only choice that makes a logical comparison: Unlike Schoenberg, .. . Bartok.</p>
<p>In A, B, and D, Bartok, a person, is compared either to Schoenberg's twelve-tone system or to Schoenberg and his twelve-tone system as a unit. Such comparisons are neither logically sound nor seman-tically parallel.</p>
<p>Consequently, A and D illogically suggest that Schoenberg's twelve-tone system founded a school and left behind many disciples.</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Choice B suggests that Schoenberg and his twelve-tone system together accomplished these feats</span>.<br><p>In E, the comparison is illogical and the modification is ambiguous (dominating). Schoenberg and his system, as a unit, are not only compared to Bartok, an individual, but also credited with having formed a school. The verb phrase dominating ... is called a "squinting modifier" because it looks in both direc?tions: given the structure of the sentence, it could be meant to modify either Schoenberg and the twelve-tone system or Bartok.</p></div>
