<h3>考点</h3>
<ol><li> 同位语要能够互相解释，且中间尽量不能隔开。</li>

<li> 平行结构</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. drama和play是句子主语的同位语，所以it不对(it是强调句的引导词，无指代)；and was与it was并列，而不是与that won并列，除非去掉and前面的逗号，并改为and that was。</li>

<li>B. in 1959隔开了同位语drama and play和A Raisin in the Sun。</li>

<li>C. drama and play不能成为Lorraine Hansberry的同位语；it指代不清晰。</li>
<li>D. Correct。</li>
<li>E. Made的动作发出者不明。</li>
