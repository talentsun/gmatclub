    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A<span>     </span>And not is not<br>a correct idiom; as should be followed by a clause</p>
<p><br>   </p>
<p>B<span>      </span>Although <i>like<br></i>can grammatically be followed by a noun phrase such as <i>nuclear reactors,<br></i>here the basis of comparison is unclear, and the usage is incorrect</p>
<p><br>   </p>
<p>C<b><span>    </span>Correct. </b><i>Rather than </i>is a correct<br>idiom for comparison in this sentence; <i>as </i>is followed by a clause with a<br>subject, <i>nuclear reactors, </i>and a verb, <i>do; </i>the comparison is<br>clear and complete.</p>
<p><br>   </p>
<p>D<span>     </span>Illogical and<br>awkward construction attempts to make <i>merges </i>the second verb of the<br>restrictive clause parallel to <i>powers </i>and <i>does not split-, </i>punctuation<br>makes clear this separate action cannot be the case; <i>as is done </i>is<br>awkward and wordy</p>
<p><br>   </p>
<p>E<span>      </span>Illogical and<br>awkward construction incorrectly makes <i>merges </i>the second verb of the<br>restrictive clause and a separate action parallel to <i>powers; </i>comparison<br>is awkwardly drawn; switch from nuclear to atomic is unexplained and<br>unsupported</p></div>
