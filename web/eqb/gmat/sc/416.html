    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：Although she had been known……，Barbara Jordan did not……，when she……</span></h3>
<h3>考点</h3>
<ol><ol><li>then与later用词重复</li>
<li>定语从句可以根据动词的单复数形式来实现跳跃修饰，使句子符合逻辑此处的impeachment 是一种法律程序，impeach的英文解释为：If a government official is impeached, they are formally charged with a serious crime in a special government court:</li>
</ol></ol><p><span style="font-style: italic;">e.g.：The governor was impeached for using state funds improperly.</span></p>
<ol><ol>因此电视直播的只能是有关这一法律程序的听证会，所以which从句只能修饰hearings，而不是这一法律程序本身。</ol></ol><p></p>
<ol><li>主从句对位指代：如果主从句主语相同，那么当主句在前时，主句主语要用名词，从句主语要用代词；当从句在前是，从句主语可以用名词也可以用代词，当从句主语用代词时，主句要用名词，当从句主语用名词时，主句主语用代词指代从句主语。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. 打破主从句对位指代规则，句式awkward—即she为although引导的让步状语从句的主语，那么最好主语一开头就是she所指代的对象，也就是Barbara Jordan，而不是not until；was made较口语化，用become更好；hearings是复数，不能用it指代。</li>
<li>B. Correct；句式简洁明确，层层递进(很明显的正确选项特征)，且符合主从句对位指代规则,<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">至于which的修饰，因为which不能指代人（前面的Nixon），所以可以跳跃地指代hearings</span></li>
<li>C. 主句主语用Barbara Jordan比较好；with引导的独立主格做伴随逻辑意思不合理；定语从句的谓语动词was主谓不一致，应该用were。</li>
<li>D. 主句主语用Barbara Jordan比较好；then与later用词重复；用as来引导伴随状语逻辑含义不合理；being做伴随状语，其逻辑主语是she，逻辑含义错误。</li>
<li>E. 错误同DC</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<p>本题存在部分倒装：</p>
<p>原句：not until Barbara Jordan's participation in the hearings on the impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974 was she made a nationally recognized figure,</p>
<p>正常语序是she was made a nationally recognized figure not until Barbara Jordan's participation in the hearings on the impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974</p></div>
