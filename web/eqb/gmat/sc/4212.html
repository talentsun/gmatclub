    Researchers have found that individuals who have been blind from birth, and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">who thus have never seen anyone gesture, nevertheless make hand motions when speaking just as frequently and in virtually the same way as sighted people do, and that they will gesture</span> even when conversing with another blind person.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>这题说的是一个事实所以应该用一般现在时态而不应该用过去时这样就可以先排除掉CD 剩下ABE看B选项虽然从句用的是make motion 但是 后面as sighted  people did还是用的过去时不对  剩下AE 这两个作比较E没有体现出平行结构（因为没有化纤的地方有一个and） 所以选A喽</p>
<p>------------</p>
<p>跟事实不事实有嘛关系？主句有一个并列结构叫 individuals who have been... 那当然用 and who have been 来并列喽，AC优选 B保留 DE having been 必杀。</p>
<p>后面看到the same way as 又是考并列结构，B项 make ... as did 就挂了。</p>
<p>整个句子还有一个大并列叫 researchers have found that individuals make/made ... and that they will gesture...  C项 as well as gesturing 不并列又挂了。</p>
<p>A三处平行对称毫无错漏。优选。</p>
