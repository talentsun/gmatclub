<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：Not one of n.s is expected to do sth. until a MA is signed that includes a provision for penalties if the deal were not to be concluded.</span>
</h3>
<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>主谓一致（agreement） 习惯用语（idiom）</h4>

<ol><li>one of the+名词复数，谓语用单数；Not one of =none of。</li>

<li>虚拟语气：与将来事实相反，条件从句的谓语be动词一律用were to+动词原形。</li>

</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Correct；a merger agreement引导的句子并不是if the deal were的主句，If the deal were中的If可以理解为"in case (that)"。</li>
<li>B. 表示动作的目的用to do比for buying更好，表示一个动作趋向；they无指代；虚拟语气用用was错误。</li>
<li>C. be signed时态错误；with a provision修饰be signed，意思成了需要一个条例来规范签署这一动作；Them无指代。</li>

<li>D. are错误，主谓不一致。For buying错误同B。虚拟语气用was错误。It指代不清，而且其实根本不需要。</li>
<li>E. are错误，主谓不一致。they无指代。</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>

<p>关于定语从句的关系代词能否跨越谓语动词指代：如果关系代词与先行词相隔较短，关系代词能跨越谓语动词指代，如本句a merger agreement is signed that includes a provision。</p></div>
