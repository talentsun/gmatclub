    Judicial rules in many states require <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that the identities of all prosecution witnesses are made known to defendants so they can attempt to rebut</span> the testimony, but the Constitution explicitly requires only that the defendant have the opportunity to confront an accuser in court.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In English the subjunctive mood is used to express a wish or requirement that a certain course of action be taken. Such phrasing takes the form <i>to wish</i> [or] <i>require that x be y,</i> not <i>that x should be y</i> or <i>that x is y.</i> Choice B, therefore, is best. In place of the subjunctive, A uses the indicative <i>are</i> and E uses an awkward gerund, <i>making</i><i>,</i> while C and D contain the unnecessary <i>should.</i><span style="color: #ff0099;"> </span><i><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0099;">A and C also omit that after so</span></span></b>,</i> and D omits <i>that</i> after <i>require.</i> The phrase <i>attempt to rebut</i> is more idiomatic than the phrases that replace it in C and D. Choices C and E awkwardly place the plural noun <i>witnesses</i> between the plural pronoun <i>they</i> and its referent, <i>defendants</i></span></span></p></div>
