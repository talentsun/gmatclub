    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：…, the chestnut was so prevalent that it was said a squirrel could jump…</p>
<p>　　主语是the chestnut，系动词was，表语prevalent，so… that…结构。</p>
<p>　　考点：习惯用语、逻辑表达</p>
<p>　　习惯用语-so that，注意so… that…的固定搭配，常见的错误选项是将enough与that搭配。</p>
<p>　　逻辑表达，主动语态能表达比被动语态更准确的含义。</p>
<p>　　(A) 正确，that后跟从句表示结果;it was said…中的it是形式主语。</p>
<p>　　(B) a squirrel was said that…被动语态的表达不如主动更明确。</p>
<p>　　(C) to be said to被动语态的表达不如主动更明确;so… to be的搭配错误。</p>
<p>　　(D) enough that搭配错误。</p>
<p>　　(E) enough to do所表达的含义与原句的so that不同;to be said to被动语态的表达不如主动更明确。</p></div>
