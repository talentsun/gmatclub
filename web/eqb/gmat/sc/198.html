    Canadian scientists have calculated that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">one human being should be struck every nine years by a meteorite</span>, while each year 16 buildings can be expected to sustain damage from such objects.

The phrase </span><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><i>once in every nine years is</i></span><span><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"> needlessly wordy</span> in B and C. Also, the language of C implies more than can reasonably be maintained: i.e., that a meteorite will strike one person, and no one else, exactly once during every nine-year period. Choice D is best: the phrasing is concise and free of unintended suggestions, and </span><span>the use of the indefinite article in <i>a human being</i> is appropriate for describing what is expected to be true only on the average.</span></p></div>
