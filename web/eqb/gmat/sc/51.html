    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><ol><li>
<p>brisk，adj，活泼的，敏锐的</p>

<li>B is the best，用to make和to distinguish平行</li>
<li>D，有歧义，用results 和hampers平行，是表明conversatinal pace引起所有人的sense of speech，而不是children</li>
</ol><p>理解句意，hamper后面有两个内容，to distinguish和to make，make不能与hamper平行。</p>
<p><span>C选项的They指代不明~前面有children和words and sounds~~都可以用THEY来指代~~~</span></p></div>
