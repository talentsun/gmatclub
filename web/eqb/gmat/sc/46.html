<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：…energy was expended on the creation of Buddha images and on construction and decoration of the temples in which they were enshrined.</span> 大平行夹着小平行，因为which指代temples，所以they就无歧义的指向之前唯一一个复数名词images。</h3>

<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>平行结构（parallelism） 逻辑意思（logical prediction） 习惯用法（idiom）</h4>

<ol><li> and前后要平行</li>
<li> expend固定搭配：expend sth. in/on (doing) sth.</li>

<li> enshrine习惯用法：enshrine in或be enshrined in</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. for the creation of Buddha images和when they constructed不平行; they constructed中constructed应该用被动语态；expend for搭配错误；temples enshrine them的用法unidiomatic。</li>

<li>B. correct。Which指代temples。</li>
<li>C. A as well as B有主次顺序，A是主要的，B是次要的，改变句意。并且construct有专门的名词construction，不应该用—ing形式，而且要平行也要在前面加个on。</li>
<li>D. construct和decorate有专门对应的名词；and前后也不平行；temples enshrine them的用法unidiomatic。</li>
<li>E. as well as错误同C。平行少on；temples enshrine them的用法unidiomatic。</li>
