    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>这道题按照<span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><b>句意</b></span>来解最方便。最关键的是看准estimate what的部分！</p>
<p>借用9楼的说法，这句话表达的意思是，按照估计，为了达到环境标准，这个cost要怎么怎么样。</p>
<p>A, C的by the end of the decade修饰 is projected 和 is estimated。句意完全不通。</p>
<p>例：A的句意：XX is projected at XX by the end of the decade; C差不多</p>
<p>B的by the end of the decade to meet environmental regulations修饰is estimated。修饰混乱且句意不通。</p>
<p>D的to meet environmental regulations修饰 is estimated。句意不通。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>我来补充一点：by the end of 不能修饰动词project 或者eatimate的，要修饰动词后的内容，排除cd。</p>

<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>A) Wrong: "US industry's cost" does not sound idiomatic, because <span>the</span> industry has incurred <span>the</span> cost, so it should be "<span>the</span> cost to <span>the</span> industry..."; <br><br>Moreover, "<span>the</span> cost IS projected at 10%.... by <span>the</span> end of <span>the</span> decade", here IS-wrong, future tense must be used. <span>The</span> idea is that "by <span>the</span> end of <span>the</span> decade, <span>the</span> cost WILL be 10% of <span>the</span> price per barrel". <br><br>B) and C) I eliminated for <span>the</span> same reasons.<br><br>D) Wrong. "To meet <span>the</span> regulations, <span>the</span> cost..." implies that <span>the</span> cost intends to meet <span>the</span> regulations, which is illogical. Wrong modifier. <br>Ano<span>the</span>r mistake is <span>the</span> incorrect present tense "..<span>the</span> cost is estimated at 10%..by <span>the</span> end of <span>the</span> decade." I can understand <span>the</span> meaning, but this is not <span>the</span> way to convey that meaning.<br><br>E) Correct.</p></div>
