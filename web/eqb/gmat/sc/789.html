    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>句子结构：Unlike the steam locomotive, which…, the diesel locomotive could… 比较结构。</p>
<p>考点：比较、指代一致 比较-unlike，连接比较对象要对等。 指代一致，形式主语it指代了句子的真正主语（真正的主语在句子后部），因为有所指，所以句子 中如果再出现其它有所指的it，就冲突了。</p>
<p>(A) 形式主语it与its指代对象不一致；unlike连接比较对象不对等，locomotive与power。</p>
<p>(B) 形式主语it与its指代对象不一致；unlike连接比较对象不对等，locomotive与engine。</p>
<p>(C) 正确，steam locomotive与diesel locomotive对比，it指代前者。</p>
<p>(D) unlike连接比较对象不对等，locomotive与engine。</p>
<p>(E) before moving…没有表达出原句所要表达的"能够，可能"的意思；almost instantly位置改变，引 起修饰歧义。</p></div>
