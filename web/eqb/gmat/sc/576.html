    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">句意应该是</span></p>
<p><b>Renoir死前最后一句话(一个词)是“花”，就在别人把从他花园摘的花插在卧室花瓶里的时候。</b></p>
<p>从句意来看 应该是有种进行的感觉，就是他说的时候，别人在插花。</p>
<p>看选项：</p>
<p><b>A.as they arranged a bouquet of roses just picked from his garden</b></p>
<p>我认为这个后面的just picked...是没有问题的，修饰roses。</p>
<p>问题是they有点奇怪，因为强调的是花，谁插的并不重要。</p>
<p>另外没有体现出正在的感觉。</p>
<p><span></span><b>B.as a bouquet of roses had been just picked from his garden and was being arranged</b></p>
<p>这个有点awkward；and连接前后动作的话，时态有问题。</p>
<p><span></span><b>C.as a bouquet of roses just picked from his garden was being arranged</b></p>
<p>just picked修饰roses所以就是as a bouquet of roses was being arranged </p>
<p><span></span><b>D.during the arrangement of a bouquet of roses just picked from his garden</b></p>
<p>arrangement相对c有点不好,van原则</p>
<p><span></span><b>E.while they arranged a bouquet of roses that had just been picked from his garden</b></p>
<p><span>they没必要，roses 后面修饰内容，不是强调时态前后，啰嗦。</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>这个题目很好的使用了being,而且不是作为介词后的being。</p>
<p>但这道题我觉得不是很GMAT。大家看看就好。</p>
