    While the expression "no great shakes" originally <span style="text-decoration:underline;">referred to gamblers who were not adept at rolling dice, they have come to connote broadly varying meanings: they</span> could refer, for example, to individuals who perform tasks only unexceptionally or, just as easily, to unmemorable or ordinary experiences.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>排除法，首先是时态:originally明显的表明前后的时态要有差别。冒号后面的主语还是前面的the expression因此是单数。根据这个可以排除ADE。</p>
<p>B和C选项的选择还是要根据逻辑来，句子的意思是：“no great shakes”原来表示...的意思，现在它有了更广泛的意思。C选项it has connoted是现在完成时，时态上肯定不对了，所以排除C。</p>
<p>答案只有B了。</p>
