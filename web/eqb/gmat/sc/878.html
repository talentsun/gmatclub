    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　A. 正确</p>
<p>　　B. 句中唯一的复数概念为earnings，they强制指代earnings，然而，这一指代关系逻辑含义不合理</p>
<p>　　C. Surpassing逻辑主语为应该为盈利，而不是report，此句surpassing修饰report，含义不合理;they强制指代earnings，逻辑含义不合理</p>
<p>　　D. that定语从句修饰对象错误，导致句子意思改变。</p>
<p>　　E. 两个句子并列(the company reported…, there would be…没有连词)，句意表达错</p>
<p>　　句子结构：The computer company reported A and announced B. 句子为两个动宾成分并列。此句更妙的地方在于，两个谓语动词实际意思相同――reported and announced，两个动词的宾语：earnings that surpassed… and price cuts intended to…. 也结构平行" 对称。</p>
<p>　　考点:句子结构(Grammatical Construction)、指代一致(Agreement)、逻辑表达(Logical Predication) 句子描述同一主语the computer company的两个动作，两谓语平行，宾语结构对称 代词指代单复数一致的名词时，要注意其逻辑意思是否合理。 现在分词结构位于句首，其逻辑主语为主句主语;定语从句修饰紧临的名词。</p></div>
