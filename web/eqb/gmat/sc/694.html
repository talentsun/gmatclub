    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 逻辑表达(Logical Predication) 比较(Comparision)</p>
<p>　　1) 逻辑主语</p>
<p>　　2) 比较双方要对等</p>
<p>　　(A) per capita consumption of cigarettes 作为initiating的逻辑主语,不符合逻辑; a drop more than twice as great as in the nation比较双方不对等,应该改为 that in the nation, that代替a drop, 构成对等的比较</p>
<p>　　(B) annual per capita consumption of cigarettes 作为initiating的逻辑主语,不符合逻辑; more than twice as great as that不符合同位语构成方式,应该补上 a drop对前面的现象进行概括</p>
<p>　　(C) California's annual per capita consumption作为initiating的逻辑主语,不符合逻辑; more than结构不符合同位语构成</p>
<p>　　(D) 正确, California作为initiating的逻辑主语,符合逻辑; a drop…结构符合同位语构成; that代替a drop使得比较双方对等</p>
<p>　　(E) more than结构不符合同位语构成; per capita和per person重复; 改变了原意“人均吸烟量每年下降……”，而E是“年人均吸烟量下降……”</p>
<p>　　句子结构: … after initiating…, California has seen…capita consumption…decline from.. to…, a drop…</p></div>
