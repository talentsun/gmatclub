<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>指代一致</h4>
<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>(A) it指代weight of the discus错误；划线部分is concentrated应该使用过去时态。</li>

<li>(B) it指代问题，同A； According to改变了原文的逻辑意思，原文不是想说根据，只是陈述客观事实。</li>
<li>(C) Correct；Designed引导的过去分词结构作定语修饰句子主语 the discus，逻辑正确。</li>
<li>(D) 全句缺少谓语动词。</li>

<li>(E) design固定搭配，没有design doing的结构；having concentrated 完成时使用没必要；后半句没有谓语动词，and now 应该为and now is 时态改变，因此不能直接并列，前半句使用的是过去时态was.</li>

</ul><p>生词:  discus n.(铁饼) 不误认做discuss</p>
<p>Perimeter n. 周边，边缘</p>
<h3>补充说明</h3>
<ol><li>design的固定搭配::design something to do something<br>be designed for somebody/something<br>be designed as something<br>be designed with sth</li>
<li>According to 与 In accordance with的区别：</li>

</ol><p>首先：According to是介词。两者的含义及句子示例，如下：</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">In accordance with</span>
<br><p>This expression emphasises the rule, principle, law etc, which is followed, and which states what should happen. This is shown in the following citations:</p>
<p>1) The Commission insists that these funds must be spent in accordance with all the Community's most sacred environmental principles, to say nothing of its legislation.</p>

<p>2) Last month, the bank's management submitted a detailed plan for making changes in accordance with the review's findings.</p>
<p>3) The court may in accordance with law grant a dissolution of the marriage provided that the court is satisfied that adequate and proper provision will be made for any dependant spouse and for any child.</p>
<p>4) Existing Sidewinders follow a preset path with the help of sets of rigid fins, at the front and back, that alter position in accordance with instructions from an on-board computer.</p>

<p>5) The UN's peace plan rests on Mr Rabbani's willingness to relinquish office next month in accordance with one of the many peace pacts he has concluded.</p>

<p>6) If such a question arises for the first time in a lawsuit, the judge will have to decide the meaning in accordance with the recognized rules of interpretation, and his decision will be a binding authority for all future cases in which the same question arises.</p>

<p>8) Our Galaxy contains at least 100 million black holes, according to calculations by a Dutch astrophysicist.</p>
<p>9) Most organochlorine pollution in the Baltic is declining, according to a joint study by scientists at Ehime University in Japan and the University of Gdansk in Poland.</p>

<p>12. Japanese oil tankers constructed according to a modern design with high-tensile steel have been    recalled for emergency repairs to cracks.</p>
<p>Notice that there is some <span style="font-weight: bold;">overlap</span> between the two expressions: so 11 and 12 could equally as well have been written (因为11，12也是一个rule):</p>

<p>13. Each of the 10,000 most common words in English is ranked in accordance with its frequency in everyday use.</p>
<p>14. Japanese oil tankers constructed in accordance with a modern design with high-tensile steel have been recalled for emergency repairs to cracks.</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">区别：</span>
<br><p>根据XX号文规定，应该怎样怎样，我们一开始都写：According to Circular ***</p>
<p>公司请了两个老外editor，专门帮我们挑报告中不规范的英语用法。然后老外就向我们提出来说，这个地方要用In accordance with，不能用according to。他们的理由是，according to 后面要跟法规的具体内容，而如果单说是根据什么什么法规，就要用in accordance with。</p>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">总结：</span>
<br><p>看 according to 一般要连更为具体的内容，通常放在句首，或者句中作插入语，根据目前的Gmat题，不需要逻辑一致。</p>

<h3>OG12-23解释</h3>
<h4>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Verb Form; Grammatical construction; Logical predication</span>
</h4>
<p>The sentence requires two tenses—past tense to describe the previous design and present tense to describe the current design of the discus. In the sentence presented here, the grammatical subject is <span style="font-style: italic;">weight</span>, not <span style="font-style: italic;">discus</span>, so the pronoun <span style="font-style: italic;">it </span>grammatically refers to <span style="font-style: italic;">weight</span>, which makes no sense.</p>

<ul><li>A. The verb tense describing the <span style="font-style: italic;">previous design </span>should be past, not present; the pronoun <span style="font-style: italic;">it </span>refers to the subject of the fi rst clause, <span style="font-style: italic;">weight</span>, and it does not make sense to say that the weight of the discus is lined with lead.</li>

<li>B. Although the tense of the verb in the fi rst clause is appropriately past, the pronoun in the second clause is still referring to <span style="font-style: italic;">weight </span>instead of <span style="font-style: italic;">discus</span>.</li>
<li>C.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct. </span>Th e introductory phrase describes the past design of the discus with a past participle (<span style="font-style: italic;">designed</span>) that modifies the subject of the main clause (<span style="font-style: italic;">the discus</span>); the main verb <span style="font-style: italic;">is lined </span>is in present tense.</li>

<li>D. This version of the sentence is a fragment because it has no main verb.</li>
<li>E. The sentence is missing a main verb in the final phrase; <span style="font-style: italic;">was once designed </span>must be followed by <span style="font-style: italic;">is now lined</span>.</li>
</ul><span style="font-weight: bold;">The correct answer is C.</span>
