    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>The best choice, A, offers an adjective phrase unequivocally modifying policy and exhibiting grammatical parallelism (decreasing ... and improving). In choice B, the gerund the decreasing is not grammatically parallel with the infinitive to improve. Likewise, in C and D, the decreasing of... costs is not parallel with improving the efficiency. In E, the infinitives to decrease and to improve, while parallel, are less idiomatic than the prepositional phrase of decreasing ... and improving in modifying the noun aim. Also, with the aim... improve can easily be construed as referring to the Baldrick ManufacÂ­turing Company and so does not refer unequivocally to policy. </p></div>
