    A recent survey showed that while many banks have service charges on interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing accounts <span style="text-decoration:underline;">with balances that are falling below</span> a set minimum, some banks provide virtually free checking regardless of the account balance.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>The sentence explains survey results that reveal two kinds of banks: those imposing service charges on accounts whose balances fall below a set minimum and those that impose virtually no service charges regardless of the amount balance. The sentence needs to make clear that the main comparison is between banks, not balances.<br>A. The phrase that are falling illogically suggests that the crucial factor is the ongoing process of falling instead of the fact that the balances drop to a certain level, and it makes this version unnecessarily wordy.<br>B. Correct. This is the clearest, most efficient, and direct way to convey the meaning of the sentence.<br>C. The unnecessary words that of are redundant and nonsensical, implying a balance of a set minimum balance.<br>D. The words that of are problematic for reasons explained for C.<br>E. The relative pronoun that introduces unnecessary wordiness. The phrase those of is problematic for the same reasons explained for that of in C.</p></div>
