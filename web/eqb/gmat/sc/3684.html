    Wind resistance created by opening windows while driving results in a fuel penalty<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> as great or greater than is incurred by using air conditioning</span>.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>1 at least as great as比as great as or greater简洁</p>
<p>2 that指代wind resistance, 比较的两种情况有平行的关系，即</p>
<p>wind resistance created by opening windows while driving 和 wind resistance incurred by using air condition</p>
<p>E中充分体现了这种平衡，因此更合理。</p></div>
