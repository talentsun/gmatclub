<h3>考点</h3>
<ol><li> 宾语从句前的that不可省略</li>

<li> 描述自然现象、统计数据、实验结论、客观事实的时候用一般现在时</li>

</ol><p>PS：同样需要注意的是在描述法律规定的时候定语从句要用Ving形式</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. Correct</li>
<li>B. Had began时态错误；第二个had应该改为has</li>
<li>C. the beginning of the universe was的表达wordy；was应该改为is；that has expanded将原句中并列的句子改为从句，改变了原句意思</li>

<li>D. 缺少that；the beginning of the universe was的表达wordy；to have been表达不正确，而且wordy；that is expanding将原句中并列的句子改为从句，改变了原句意思</li>
<li>E. 缺少that；and前的句子主谓不完整</li>

<h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical predication; Verb form</span>

</h4>
<p>The sentence describes the central tenet of a theory about how the universe began. The focus of the second clause should be consistently on the subject <span style="font-style: italic;">the universe</span>, and all verbs in the clause beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">that </span>must describe what the universe did at the initial explosive moment.</p>

<ul><li>A.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct. </span>Both verbs in the second clause correctly take <span style="font-style: italic;">universe </span>as their subject.</li>

<li>B. <span style="font-style: italic;">Had begun </span>is the wrong tense because it describes action that occurred farther in the past than some other, specifi ed past action.</li>

<li>C. The relative clause that has expanded describes instant, which makes no sense.</li>
<li>D. <span style="font-style: italic;">The beginning of the universe to have been </span>… is unnecessarily indirect and wordy; illogically suggests that <span style="font-style: italic;">beginning </span>is expanding, not the universe.</li>

<li>E. The verb phrases <span style="font-style: italic;">to have begun </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">has been expanding </span>both reference the same subject of the clause, <span style="font-style: italic;">universe</span>, and therefore need to be parallel.</li>

</ul><p>下划线的两个句子并不矛盾，因为that从句前面的beginning be an instant是主系表结构，所以that从句describe的是instant和beginning.</p></div>
