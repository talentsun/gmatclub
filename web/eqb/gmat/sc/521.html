<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：The IR, which made possible sth., was marked by the use of X, Y, and Z.</span></h3>
<h3>考点</h3>
<p>句子结构（grammatical construction） 平行结构（parallelism）</p>
<ol><li>make sth. adj结构中如果sth.过长，可以宾语导致：make adj. sth.。</li>
<li>and前后平行。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. their无所指，若指代goods则逻辑意思错误；用to mass-produce或the mass prodcution都没有问题。</li>
<li>B. mark应用被动，缺少助动词was。</li>
<li>C. 用that引导名词性成分过去累赘；their无所指，是的by their using动作发出者不明；by one's using累赘。</li>
<li>D. correct；用make it possible to mass-produce或make possible the mass prodcution都没有问题。</li>
<li>E. 句子只有一个主语；using的动作发出者成了Industrial Revolution，不合逻辑。</li>
