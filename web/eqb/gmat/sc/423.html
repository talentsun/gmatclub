<h3>考点</h3>
<p>逻辑表达</p>
<ol><li>名词的表达形式，如果动词本身有名词表达式，则不用+ing的形式表示名词；同时，动名词强调动作，只能和动名词并列，不能和强调结果的名词并列。</li>
<li>注意逻辑表达是否合理。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. excavating不好，在表达一件已经完成的事情的时候，除非这个动词没有-tion的形式，一般都用-tion的形式，(如excavation),而不用doing的形式(如excavating)，doing强调动作；that引导名词性从句逻辑和语法上都没有什么问题，只是不够简洁。</li>
<li>B.<span style="font-weight: bold;">主语用Twenty-one ceramic dog figurines没什么问题</span>；主谓不一致，如果figurines做主语，在未划线部分的谓语动词has应为复数。</li>
<li>C. at the excavating不好，在表达一件已经完成的事情的时候，一般都用-tion的形式，(如excavation),而不用doing的形式(如excavating)，doing强调动作；有discovery就不用discovering因为本身有了名词形式了。</li>
<li>D. 不是所有的小泥狗has doubled，而是就挖出来的那21只小泥狗使得数量加倍；excavating不好，在表达一件已经完成的事情的时候，一般都用-tion的形式，(如excavation),而不用doing的形式(如excavating)，doing强调动作。</li>
<li>E. Correct；Discovery可以作double的主语.参见OG10,49题</li>
</ul><p>相关题目</p>
<p>49. The cameras of the Voyager II spacecraft detected six small, previously unseen moons circling Uranus, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">which doubles to twelve the number of satellites now known as orbiting</span> the distant planet</p>
<ul><li>(A) which doubles to twelve the number of satellites now known as orbiting</li>
<li>(B) doubling to twelve the number of satellites now known to orbit</li>
<li>(C) which doubles to twelve the number of satellites now known in orbit around</li>
<li>(D) doubling to twelve the number of satellites now known as orbiting</li>
<li>(E) which doubles to twelve the number of satellites now known that orbit</li>
</ul><p>The pronoun which should be used to refer to a previously mentioned noun, not to the idea expressed in an entire clause. In A, C, and E, which seems to refer to a vague concept invol?ving the detection of moons, but there is no specific noun, such as detection, to which it can refer. Also in E, the use of the phrasing the number... now known that orbit is ungrammatical and unclear. B and D use the correct participial form, doubling, to modify the preceding clause, but D, like A, uses known as orbiting rather than known to orbit, a phrase that is more idiomatic in context. B, therefore, is the best answer.</p></div>
