</h3>

<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>题目释义 逻辑表达 平行对称</h4>
<ol><li>逻辑主语，prep+doing, svo. doing的逻辑主语等于主句主语。</li>
<li>代词指代，its应该指代the restaurant company</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Correct。</li>

<li>B. has recently added… and… increased时态不平行，发生在同一时间的事情应该用统一时态。</li>

<li>C. its指代模糊；many new restaurants have recently been opened没有体现出动作的发出者，使得句意含糊。</li>
<li>D. having recently add的逻辑主语应该是the restaurant company，但本句成了the restaurant company's sales；with伴随状语发生时间不定，根据伴随主句的原则，应该是与主句发生时间一致，错误。</li>
<li>E. adding与having逻辑主语成了sales错误；having adding变为adding，having had改为having，时态的更改引起句意的不合理</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<ol><li> 位于句首的doing的动作发出者或者done的动作承受者，即为该分词的逻辑主语，等于主句主语。doing…, SVO  =  S do<br>done…, SVO  =  S be done</li>

<li> Having done / having been done, SVO非谓语动词的完成式－动词发生在主句前</li>

<li> 需要关注逻辑主语的几种短语：</li>
</ol><p>(1) prep+doing, SVO    prep=in/by/for/after/in addition to</p>
<p>(2) adj.+prep+n., SVO</p></div>
