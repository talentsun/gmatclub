<h3>考点</h3>

<ol><li> 比较结构</li>
<li> 倍数表达：twice (as much as) sth.; X times adj. than; X times as adj. as; double sth.</li>

</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. is being错误，删去being后可以直接用as much as that emitted annually。</li>
<li>B. Is多余；比较双方不明确，后面应用补出that；annually放在as…as结构中间成为比较双方共享的东西，造成与前面的annually重复。</li>

<li>C. as…compared to搭配错误；what is annually emitted by all中what的范围大于the total amount of pollutant，而且其实可以简化。</li>

<li>D. Correct；twice后面可以直接接名词，twice as much as也是对的。</li>
<li>E. compared to重复。</li>
</ul></div>
