    <div class="explanation" style="display:none">考点: 比较（Comparison） 比较双方必须概念对等: like + 名词, 表示比较,侧重同类事物的比较as的用法: as后面加上名词,表示作为…的意思; as加句子,表示两个动作之间的相似性,例: He was known to all as a famous writer. He runs fast as a leopard does.(A) 正确, 比较双方Rousseau和Tolstoi概念对等(B) 比较双方Rousseau和Tolstoi's rebellion不对等(C) as + n表示作为…的意思, Tolstoi作为Rousseau不符合逻辑意思(D) as + 句子表示动作之间的比较, Tolstoi's rebellion was…没有动作性动词,无法和did比较(E) Tolstoi's rebellion作为Rousseau's不符合逻辑意思句子结构: Like Rousseau, Tolstoi rebelled against…OG10解释： In choice A, the best answer, a clear and logical comparison is made between Rousseau and Tolstoi. Choice B illogically compares a person, Rousseau, to an event, Tolstoi's rebellion. Also, Tolstoi's rebellion was against is less direct than Tolstoi rebelled against. Inserting did after As would make C grammatical. Because As is a conjunction, it must " introduce a clause; hence the noun Rousseau must have a verb.  Choice D compares an implied action (As did Rousseau) with a noun (Tolstoi's rebellion).Choice E is awkwardly formed, and like is needed in place of as to compare two nouns  (rebellion is understood after Rousseau's). Also, Tolstoi's rebellion... was against is less direct than Tolstoi rebelled against.</div>
