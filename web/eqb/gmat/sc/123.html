<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>句子结构，比较对象对等</h4>
<h4>1) Less要与than搭配，不能与(as) compared to搭配。</h4>
<h4>2) Run-on sentence.</h4>
<p>aeoluseros关于run-on sentence知识点的补充：</p>
<p>找过很多解释，包括一些语法书(也包括老外的)、百度，始终觉得措辞上不合适，不过在一本手册上终于看到了满意的解释：</p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">run-on sentence 连写句：</span>

<br><p>连写句指错误将两个独立分句合写在一个句子里面没有正确地用标点分离。</p>
<p>连写句有两种类型：</p>
<p>溶合句(fused sentence)：根本不使用标点把两个独立分句合写在一个句子里</p>
<p>逗号错误(comma splice):使用逗号但没有并列连词将两个独立分句写在一个句子里。</p>
<p>BTW: 所谓的独立分句即"主句"，其对应的是"从句"，都属于"分句"。</p>
<p>而run-on sentence的重点在于其改正方法：</p>
<ol><li> 分为两个句子</li>

<li> 用一个逗号加上and, but, or或者其他并列连词</li>
<li> 两个句子中间使用分号</li>
</ol><p>This sentence compares the success J experienced after moving to New York to the success she had previously experienced in Germany. The phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">less successful </span>anticipates the conclusion of the comparison with the phrase<span style="font-style: italic;"> than… </span>. The main subject of the sentence is <span style="font-style: italic;">photographer LJ </span>, and the main verb is<span style="font-style: italic;"> earned </span>. The opening clause <span style="font-style: italic;">She was less successful….</span> Therefore creates a comma splice if the comma is not followed by a conjunction. The most efficient way to incorporate the information about J's comparative successes in Germany and in New York is to turn the clause into an adjectival phase describing J. (FROM OG12)</p>

<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. <span style="font-style: italic;">Less successful… </span>anticipates <span style="font-style: italic;">than </span>rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">compared to… </span>; a comma is insufficient to join two independent clauses into a single sentence.</li>
<li>B. <span style="font-style: italic;">As compare to</span> is an incorrect way to complete the comparison introduced by <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span>; <span style="font-style: italic;">being…</span> is unnecessarily wordy and awkward.</li>

<li>C. Correct.</li>
<li>D. <span style="font-style: italic;">When compared to</span> is an incorrect phrase to complete the comparison introduced <span style="font-style: italic;">by less</span>.</li>
<li>E. A comma is insufficient to join two independent clauses into a single sentence; past-perfect tense is misleading, since it refers to J's experience in New York, which in fact followed her experience in Germany.</li>
