    In 1995 Richard Stallman, a well-known critic of the patent system, testified in Patent Office hearings that, to test the system, a colleague of his had managed to win a patent for one of Kirchhoff's <span style="text-decoration:underline;">laws, an observation about electric current first made in 1845 and</span> now included in virtually every textbook of elementary physics.

<p><span>这道题在做的时候根本没有看明白什么意思。只是从平行结构和修饰两方面做的判断。GMAT喜欢用同位语修饰大于定语修饰，能用词组就不用句子。当把G当成一个训练机构时就会明白他一次次的出题只是为了训练我们按照他的思路理解和写作问题。</span></p></div>
