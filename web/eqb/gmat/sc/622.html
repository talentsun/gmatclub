    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 句子结构(Grammatical Construction)、比较(Comparison)</p>
<p>　　1) 宾语从句强调整体, 谓语+宾语结构只强调宾语 参考17题</p>
<p>　　2) 对比对象中出现的重复名词用that或those代替,而不能用it来指代. that代替前面出现的单数名词,those代替前面出现的复数名词</p>
<p>　　3) 修饰成分应该尽量紧靠修饰对象</p>
<p>　　4) being的错误使用: 以下几种表达中being属于多余</p>
<p>　　a) being + n. b) being + adj. c) as being + n./adj./v-ing</p>
<p>　　(A) 用名词结构rental rates for…as…代替that从句,使得句子结构复杂,混乱; it没有指代</p>
<p>　　(B) 句子结构混乱;what多余;for property located离修饰对象charged太远</p>
<p>　　(C) 句子结构混乱;being多余;lower as应该改为lower than; they应该改为those</p>
<p>　　(D) being多余,for property located应该紧靠charged</p>
<p>　　(E) 正确, 使用that从句来表现recognized的全部内容;those指代前面出现的rental rates表达正确, for property located紧靠修饰对象charged,使得句子意思表达清晰</p>
<p>　　句子结构: Although unhappy…, the chief executive recognized that rental rates… were far lower</p></div>
