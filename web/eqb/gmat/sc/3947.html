    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>题目释义：Minivans [carry …,] and [compared with sport utility vehicles, most cost …, get<br><br>better …, allow …, and have …]<br><br>两个分句的平行：第一个分句主语minivans，第二个分句主语most，指代minivans；compared with<br><br>sport utility vehicles，做状语修饰其后面的分句。<br><br>考点：<br><br>平行对称 逻辑含义<br><br>1. 一组元素平行时，必须并且仅在最后一个元素前加and。<br><br>选项分析：<br><br>A. 划线部分第一个and破坏了平行结构，这组平行的最后一个元素是have a smoother, more car-like ride；<br><br>划线部分的easy没有比较级，也是破坏了平行；make it easier for passengers结构不如E简洁。<br><br>B. 划线部分第一个and破坏了平行结构，这组平行的最后一个元素是have a smoother, more car-like ride；<br><br>划线部分的easy没有比较级，也是破坏了平行。<br><br>C. 划线部分第一个and破坏了平行结构。<br><br>D. it指代不清，make it easier for passengers结构不如E简洁。<br><br>E. Correct。<br><br>补充说明：<br><br>make与allow是同义词，在本题的语境下可以互换使用，只是allow sb. to do sth. easily比make it easy<br><br>for sb. to do sth.简洁，前者不需要用到形式宾语it来指代to do sth.：<br><br>(1) make：to cause something to happen, or cause a particular state or condition<br><br>make sth difficult/easy/possible etc<br><br>The use of computers has made it possible for more people to work from home.<br><br>(2) allow：to make it possible for something to happen or for someone to do something, especially<br><br>something helpful or useful<br><br>allow sb to do sth<br><br>A 24-hour ceasefire allowed the two armies to reach an agreement.<br><br>类似例题链接1：<br><br>prep1-247, GWD-3-Q39<br><br>Minivans carry as many as seven passengers and, compared with most sport utility vehicles, cost less, get<br><br>better gas mileage, allow passengers to get in and out more easily, and have a smoother ride.<br><br>A.
