    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>首先来看AC与BDE的区别，是有无which的问题。</p>
<p>如果是BDEknown as是修饰construction的（A of B，A是中心词）。</p>
<p>所以杀BDE, AC which就近修饰<span>Roman Colosseum合理。</span></p>
<p><span>再来看AC的区别在于有无and。</span></p>
<p><span>本句的主句是<span>Construction <span> began in A.D. 69, <span>was completed a decade later.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>construction的两个动词之间应该用and连接。</p>
<p>==MercuuReal below==</p>
<p>划线最后有and的是并列句，and后面是一个谓语动词was completed，所以BE都没有谓语动词都错（B那个begun是begin的分词形式，是一个状语从句省略或定语从句省略，反正错）C可以。剩下两个A重复谓语，D重复主语。所以只能选C</p></div>
