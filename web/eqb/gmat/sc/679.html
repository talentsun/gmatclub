    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>考点</h3>
<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;">简洁有效（Rhetorical Construction）</span></p>
<p>being错误使用: 以下几种表达中being属于多余a) being + n. b) being + adj. c) as being + n./adj./v-ingas不能作为关系代词引导定语从句, 关系代词正确的使用:that(指代人,GMAT语法中that不能指代 人),which(指代物),who(指代人,主格),whom(指代人,宾格),whose(指代人或物)</p>
<h3>选项分析<br></h3>
<ul><li>(A) being多余,应该删除；分词后置定语promped…就近修饰growth不符合逻辑。</li>
<li>(B) 正确, leaving伴随结果做状语修饰主语,结构简洁; that从句修饰consumer demand符合语法要求</li>
<li>(C) as不能作为关系代词引导定语从句</li>
<li>(D) being多余,应该删除；分词后置定语promped…就近修饰growth不符合逻辑。</li>
<li>(E) in the fact of不符合习惯用法,应该使用in the fact that</li>
</ul><h3>句子结构</h3>
<p>Stock levels… are far lower than…, leaving domestic oil price vulnerable to any hints of… or any…demand growth…</p>
<h3>补充说明</h3>
<p>该句中的并列结构vulnerable to any…or to any和vulnerable to any… or any表达都正确, 第二个to和第一个to功能一样,可以省略 leaving和resulting in the fact that表达都正确,但是前者比后者简洁.</p></div>
