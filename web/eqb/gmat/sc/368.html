<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>句子结构（Grammatical Construction）</h4>

<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. he destroyed前面的成分被悬挂；so...that 结构，缺少that；</li>
<li>B. and was无并列对象；consider sb/sth sth，中间不能加as和to be。</li>
<li>C. in his later years前面的成份被悬挂；consider sb/sth sth，中间不能加as和to be；so...that结构不完整；destroying伴随对象不明确。</li>
<li>D. Correct。</li>
<li>E. 缺少谓语动词；consider sb/sth sth，中间不能加as和to be；destroying伴随对象不明确。</li>

</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>

<h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">目的状语从句和结果状语从句   -</span>  serendipityh</h4>

<ol><li>so/such...that...表示结果，可以用在单一主谓结构中，也可以用在复杂主谓结构中，不用考虑逻辑主语。such 后一般不加抽象名词.特别说明：so/such...as to...表示结果，用于单一主谓结构中，逻辑主语等于句子主语，即句子主语可以执行as to 后动词的动作。such后一般不加抽象名词.</li>
<li>so that状语从句: 从句中出现情态动词, so that表示目的；从句中没有出现情态动词，so that表示结果。such that状语从句；表示结果。so / such that 从句不用考虑逻辑主语. So that 不能修饰名词短语</li>
</ol><p>Such...that such 后加被修饰的名次</p>

<p>特别说明：so as to 可以表示目的也可以表示结果，用于单一主谓结构中，逻辑主语等于句子主语，即句子主语可以执行as to后动词的动作。so as to 修饰动词</p>
<p>so...as的搭配只用在否定句中, So…as to 后一般不加被动语态</p></div>
