<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>平行结构；逻辑含义</h4>
<ol><li> 过去时用于描述过去发生的事件，过去完成时用于描述过去某一时点或时间之前发生并完成的事件。过去完成时的使用首先要有明确的时间点进行提示，第二要合理的体现出"已经完成"的含义。</li>
<li> 当并列的短语中都包含is/was/were时，只有当其表示相同意义，即都为be动词或助动词时，才可省略。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>(A)  Correct；需要找一个joined..., was injured..., and was discharged....的平行结构，只有此选项符合要求；使用过去完成时表明了she become too ill to serve 是发生在was discharged in 1783之前；she become too ill to serve 就是仅修饰最后半个句子，所以作者在这里特意用逗号把后半个句子和前面区分开为了避免歧义，<span style="font-weight: bold;">because状从修饰的只是最后的动作</span>，所以放在最后。</li>

<li>(B)  while从句的事情与主句时间不是发生在同一时间，使用while时间状语错误，同时破坏句子平行结构； being使用多余，while being构成了被动语态的过去进行时态，这个动作应该是一个过去式动词。</li>
<li>(C) 第一个and多余，应改为逗号；discharge应该使用被动语态；being现在分词作状语修饰discharged表伴随结果，逻辑不合理。</li>
<li>(D) 动词并列，injured应该用被动，前要补出was才能与joined和was discharged并列；because she was中用了一般过去时也是可以的。</li>
<li>(E) 用了having been injured…and discharged做前面主句的伴随状语，表明be injured and discharged发生在joined之前，逻辑错误；and前面没有逗号隔开使得in 1783的修饰对象改变，原文是在1783年退役，现在是被伤了3次及退役都发生在1783，同时being修饰的对象把be injured也包括了进去。</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>

<p>OG12-36解释：</p>
<h4>Parallelism; Logical predication</h4>
<p>This sentence introduces Deborah Sampson with a description of Sampson when she first enlisted, and goes on to describe her career in the Continental Army. The information about her historical significance interrupts the chronological flow of the sentence and must therefore be set off with commas. The sequence of events that marks her career must be presented as a parallel series of items.</p>

<ul><li>A.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct</span>. The phrase that describes Deborah Sampson as the first woman to draw a soldier's pension intervenes between the subject and predicate of the main verb and thus is appropriately set off with commas; the three verbs in the main clause are in parallel form.</li>
<li>B. While being … indicates that Sampson was injured at the same time she was discharged from the Army.</li>
<li>C. Discharged should be in passive voice—was discharged—because Sampson did not do this herself.</li>
<li>D. Injured needs to be in passive voice.</li>

<li>E. having been injured … indicates that all Sampson's injuries as well as her discharge occurred in 1783.</li>
