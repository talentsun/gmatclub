<h3>考点</h3>
<ol><li> 平行结构中要注意平行对象要对等（形式和功能），动作性名词不能和名词性名词平行并列</li>

<li> "A variety of + 复数名词"后面谓语用复数形式；"a body of/a collection of/an arrary of/a series of/a set of/a portion of/a group of/ a constellation of/a team of + 复数名词"作主语后面谓语都用单数形式，因为后面是of引导的介宾短语做形容词。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. a variety of +复数名词，谓语动词用复数，且which引导的定语从句修饰approaches，所以includes错；their reducing中their多余(有效性错误)。</li>
<li>B. includes主谓不一致错误；to be more efficient in doing sth.不如to do sth. more efficiently简洁。</li>
<li>C. Correct；reducing, using, finding三者平行。</li>
<li>D. reduction，their using与finding不平行</li>
<li>E. reduction，use与finding不平行；use of new technology to be more efficient改变句意，变得不合理(更加有效率地使用新技术，合理句意应该是新技术使得pump更加有效率)。</li>

</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<ol><li> In attempt to与in attempting to没有区别</li>

<li> Efficient at与efficient in doing sth.都可以：</li>
</ol><span style="font-weight: bold;">at </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Their equipment was not as efficient at finding gold as today's machinery.</span>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">in </span>

<span style="font-style: italic;">The heating system is very efficient in its use of of fuel.</span>
