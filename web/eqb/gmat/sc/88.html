<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>平行结构（parallelism） 逻辑意思（logical prediction）</h4>
<ol><li> both…and平行结构，正确的搭配是Both X and Y 或 Both in X and in Y.</li>

<li> 关于职位、称号的同位语的用法，见补充说明。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. 用非限定性定语从句不如用同位语简洁；both…and…结构不完整。</li>
<li>B. Thelonious Monk, the jazz pianist and composer不如Jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk简洁；both错误同A。</li>
<li>C. ", who…Duke Ellington,…"，句子结构变成了"主语+定语从句+转折句"，中间没有谓语。</li>

<li>D. Correct。</li>
<li>E. both错误同A；rooted with没有问题。</li>

</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>

<h4>关于同位语用法中的the和逗号（如B选项中的TM, the jazz pianist and composer）--摘自Manhattan：</h4>
<p>if you preface someone's name with a noun describing their occupation (or other word describing <span style="font-style: italic;">what that person does</span>), <span style="font-weight: bold;">WITHOUT AN ARTICLE, OR WITH THE DEFINITE ARTICLE "THE"</span>, you DO NOT use a comma. 如果把职位、称号放在人名前面，<span style="font-weight: bold;">如果没有冠词</span>，<span style="font-weight: bold;">或者有定冠词</span>，就不用逗号（本题的情况）。</p>

<p>example:</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk ...</span> --&gt; correct<br><p>注意：</p>
<ol><li> if you are using "THE (description) (name)" to introduce someone for the first time, then you DON'T use a comma.但有要注意：当职位、称号前是定冠词时，如果是第一次提到某人，是不必用逗号的example:</li>
<span style="font-style: italic;">The author Ernest Hemingway was known for his drunken and violent escapades.</span>
<br>--&gt; here we are introducing hemingway, so we don't use a comma.<br><li> if you have already introduced two or more people, but you are using "THE (description) to single out one of them, then you DO use a comma.example：</li>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Among her friends were an author and a painter; the author, Ernest Hemingway, went on to become an icon of American literature.</span>
<br>--&gt; we've already introduced "the author"; this time we use a comma to single him out.<br><li> if there's an indefinite article (a/an), you DO use a comma. 如果前面有不定冠词，就要用逗号。example</li>
<span style="font-style: italic;">A jazz pianist and composer, Thelonious Monk ...</span> --&gt; correct<br><li> if it's an adjective, you DO use a comma. 如果前面不是职位、称号，而是一个形容词，那就要用逗号。</li>

</ol><p>example:</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Creative and original, Thelonious Monk ...</span> --&gt; correct<br></div>
