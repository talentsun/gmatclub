    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_449" value="B"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>first of all this question is a bit controversial.</p>
<p>before we do this question, we need to define whether the internet industry is among the more established industries. if it is, both answer (a) and (d) can do. they both mean the internet industry is less established. so if there is gonna be only one answer, the first half sentence should contridict the second half of the setence, which should be (b). it means even though the internet industry is among the more established industries, it is not like other ones. </p>
<p>如果这题的正确答案真的是B，那么只能说pearson VUE出题越来越主观随意了。</p>
<p>1，A one day maybe B the next, A和B应该平行</p>
<p>那么，最理想的表达应该是  companies that are competitors one day may be partners the next</p>
<p>这是完美的平行，然而选项里没有这样的选择。那么，competing companies和companies that compete哪个更合适呢？competing作为现在分词做定语，强调动作性、动作的重复、持续性。但在明天显然已经不再compete了，那么是否还有动作性，重复性，持续性可言？</p>
<p>2，the的特指性和不带the时候单用plural noun的泛指性：这里没有标明lines of competition有任何特指性，而作为被比较的两个不同性质的industries, 在各自industries前面加上the是没问题的。</p>
<p> </p>
<p>综上所述，此题应该选A.</p></div>
