<p>Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) was unprecedented in its firsthand accounts of the indignities suffered by women and in the eloquence and passion with which it exposed and criticized these indignities.</p>
<ol><li>Be unprecedented in sth 在…方面是史无前例的；</li>
<li>In its firshand accounts of …. 和 in the eloquence and passion with…平行结构；其中accounts和eloquence and passion属于名词对名词的平行，其他成分都是修饰这两个核心词；</li>
<li>in the eloquence and passion with which it exposed and criticized these indignities是倒装结构，其中which指代eloquence and passion，正常的语序是：it exposed and criticized these indignities with eloquence and passion</li>
</ol><p>本题可以登上杨鹏难句了，这种大平行加倒装的句子在考场上第一眼看到会很头晕，只能没事就多看看，锻炼考场上一眼就能看出来的能力。</p>
