</h3>

<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>逻辑表达( logical prediction); 主谓一致(agreement); 题目释义（Grammatical Construction）</h4>
<p>固定搭配：view sth. as sth. 而view sth. to be sth.错误。</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Correct；viewing做伴随；balanced后面省略的economy，view the economy as balanced economy。</li>
<li>B. view sth as sth；between that of中的that无所指；and are没有并列对象；policy makers缺谓语。</li>
<li>C. policy makers缺谓语动词；who做限定性修饰使得语义上不合理。</li>

<li>D. view sth as sth；between that of中的that无所指；will be时态错误，be certain是发生在现在的动作。</li>

<li>E. view sth as sth.；which就近修饰Reserve; is 应该改为are, 因为policy makers 是主语</li>
</ul></div>
