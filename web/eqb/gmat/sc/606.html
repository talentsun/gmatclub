    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 逻辑表达(Logical Predication)、动词形式(Verb Form)、指代一致(Agreement)</p>
<p>　　1) 分词短语在句首起状语作用,逻辑主语等于句子主语</p>
<p>　　2) it不能指代介词短语, it可以指代主语从句和不定式结构: It is difficult to do this research. It is</p>
<p>　　important that we finish on time. 在这两个例子中it分别指代to do this research和that从句</p>
<p>　　3) 现在完成时的时间状语</p>
<p>　　for, since, so far, ever, never, just, yet, till / until, up to now, in past years…</p>
<p>　　(A) 正确, after + n.结构避免了逻辑主语问题; less than 35 years after …符合习惯用法</p>
<p>　　(B) since releasing放在句首,逻辑主语等于句子的主语their descendants, 不符合逻辑; since是现</p>
<p>　　在完成时的标志和had migrated矛盾; since的使用不符合习惯用法</p>
<p>　　(C) since是现在完成时的标志和had migrated矛盾; since的使用不符合习惯用法</p>
<p>　　(D) it不能指代介词短语from the release…</p>
<p>　　(E) it不能指代介词短语from the release…</p>
<p>　　句子结构: Less than 35 years after… their descendants,…, had migrated…</p>
<p>　　补充说明:since的四种用法:since +过去一个时间点(如具体的年、月、日期、钟点、1980, last month, half past six)。 I have been here since 1989.since +一段时间+ ago I have been here since five months ago.since +从句 Great changes have taken place since you left. Considerable time has elapsed since we have been here. It is +一段时间+ since从句 It is two years since I became a postgraduate student.</p></div>
