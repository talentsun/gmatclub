    Most of Portugal's 250,000 university students boycotted classes in a one-day strike to protest a law that requires them to contribute $330 a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">year toward the cost of higher education, previously paying $7 per year</span>.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>句子主题结构：</p>
<p>Students boycotted classes in ..strike to protest a law that requires them to ...a year _______________________________</p>
<p>选项A中，paying作为伴随状语伴随前面that从句中的动作 requires发生，从而导致pay也是require的主语law发出的。而逻辑上是学生们pay这个钱，因此逻辑不通，错。</p>
<p>B中， for which was previously paid ...虽然for which指代逻辑上没问题了，但是for which..还原后变成 for the cost of higher education was paid 7 per year.  缺少主语，整个从句变成了目的状语，也失去了和前面330的可比性</p>
<p>C previously是副词，不能直接修饰名词。</p>
<p>D 正确</p>
<p>E as opposed: protest against是固定搭配。而且即便as opposed没问题，逻辑也错了，学生游行不是opposed to 以前的7块钱一年。</p></div>
