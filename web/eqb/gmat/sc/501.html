<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A，increases...accounts主谓单复数不一致</li>
<li>B，what accounted for不简洁，分号后句子不完整</li>
<li>C is the best，互勉the remainder of the increase coming做独立主格【一般独立主格，与主句形成松散的逻辑关系，形式为：n.+n. ;n.+-ed/-ing形式;n.+介词短语；n.+形容词短语】</li>
<li>D，sentence fragment，没有主句谓语</li>
<li>E，sentence fragment，没有主句谓语，it指代不清</li>
</ul><p>句子结构，考点：1，主句主语increases，谓语accounted for，2，the remainder… 是独立主格。</p>
