    By recording the noise of crinkled wrappers as they were slowly stretched out in an otherwise silent chamber, and then <span style="text-decoration:underline;">digitizing and analyzing the sound emissions on computers, a team of scientists found the noise not</span> continuous but consisted of individual bursts or pops just thousandths of a second long.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 逻辑表达(Logical Predication) 平行对称(Parallelism)</p>
<p>　　1) 正式书面语中，动词型宾语从句中的that一般不能省略</p>
<p>　　2) not…but…连接的对象要平行</p>
<p>　　3) 一般来说在report, predicate, predict, shown等动词后面之跟简单的名词短语, 若其后面跟的是动名词或名词所有格+动名词短语(sb’s doing),或名词短语之后用一复杂的现在分词来修饰时,都会造成句子结构的复杂,笨拙. 经常用that引导宾语从句来对该类句子进行改写</p>
<p>　　(A) not continuous but consisted结构不平行,continuous是形容词,consisted是动词; 应该用found that从句来表现found的完整内容</p>
<p>　　(B) 正确, By recording…, and then digitizing and analyzing结构平行; 使用found that从句更能够清楚完整的表达found的内容</p>
<p>　　(C) not to be continuous but consisted结构不平行; 应该用found that从句来表现found的完整内容</p>
<p>　　(D) By recording… and then the sound emissions were digitized…结构不平行;the sound emissions作为by recording…的逻辑主语，错误。</p>
<p>　　(E) not…but..连接对象不平行;the sound emmissions作为by recording…的逻辑主语，错误。</p>
<p>　　句子结构: By recording…, and then digitizing and analyzing…, a team… found that the noise was not…but consisted of…</p></div>
