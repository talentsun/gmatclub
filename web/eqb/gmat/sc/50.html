    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Grammatical construction; Rhetorical construction</p>
<p>The original sentence successfully avoids the problems that may occur in a long sentence with multiple modifiers. Two subordinate clauses begin with that, and one of them is contained within another. That many had feared earlier in the year clearly defines the recession. Th at the economy will avoid … and instead (will understood) come… is the subordinate clause that follows the main clause; its subject, economy, is followed by two parallel verbs, will avoid and (will understood) come. Instead before the second verb properly indicates contrast.</p>
<p>A Correct. Th is sentence contains two correct subordinate clauses introduced by that.</p>
<p>B What cannot replace that; the economy to avoid the recession is awkward and unclear; rather to come does not complete the second part of the sentence idiomatically.</p>
<p>C Earlier in the year should follow many had feared, rather than preceding it; instead to<br>come does not complete the second part of the sentence idiomatically.</p>
<p>D The recession must be followed by that; were fearing is the wrong tense; rather to come does not complete the second part of the sentence idiomatically.</p>
<p>E The passive voice construction that was feared … is weak and wordy; with it instead<br>coming is awkward, wordy, and ungrammatical.</p>
<p>The correct answer is A.</p></div>
