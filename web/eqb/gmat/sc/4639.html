<div class="question" id="question_4639">
    Trying to mimic some of the pitch variations of a dolphin chattering is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the same as attempting to sing like a sick parakeet when one is intoxicated</span>: the complete lack of harmony and apparent randomness of the noise means the human vocal chords are completely incapable of reproducing these sounds.
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4639" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>the same as attempting to sing like a sick parakeet when one is intoxicated</span></div>

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>这题关键是找到平行的结构：</p>
<p>trying to mimic......is the same as attempting to sing......</p>
<p>这样就只有A才符合这种平行，其他都不行。</p></div>
