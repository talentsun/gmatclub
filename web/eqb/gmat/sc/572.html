    Biologists working in Spain say that their discovery of teeming life in a highly acidic river may not only broaden the search for life, or for evidence of past life, no other planets but also <span style="text-decoration:underline;">show that a number of forms of microscopic life can adapt to conditions that scientists have long thought hostile to all but the hardiest bacteria</span>.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>划线部分前面是but also, 考点在平行对称结构，回到前面的对应结构叫 not only [broaden] 所以BCDE的动词都不能平行对称, 直接排除。</p>
<p>如果对选项B还有保留，那么划线头部的点考过了，就是考划线尾部的点。尾部,B的宾语是：all bacteria but the hardest ones 出现了ones 代词，容易出现指代不明，不作优选，（这里叫做扭捏作态，A的说法 all but the hardest bateria 没有出现代词，修饰清晰，没有容易出错的点）。</p>
<p>综上，直接可选A</p></div>
