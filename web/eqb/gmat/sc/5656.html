<div class="question" id="question_5656">
    Mall owner: Our mall's occupancy rate is so low that we are barely making a profit. We cannot raise rents because of an unacceptably high risk of losing established tenants. On the other hand, a mall that is fully occupied costs about as much to run as one in which a rental space here and a rental space there stands empty. Clearly, therefore, to increase profits we must sign up new tenants.

Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5656" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The mall's operating costs could be cut by consolidating currently rented spaces in such a way that an entire wing of the mall could be closed up. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5656" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The mall is located in a geographic area in which costs incurred for air-conditioning in the hot summers exceed those incurred for heating in the mid winters by a wide margin. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5656" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The mall's occupancy rate, though relatively low, has been relatively stable for several years. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5656" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>The mall lost tenants as a result of each of the two major rent increases that have occurred there. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5656" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span> None of the mall's established tenants is likely to need additional floor space there in the foreseeable future.</span></div>
