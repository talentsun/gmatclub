    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　1) 句子结构</p>
<p>　　2) while+doing现在分词表达时间状语的方式;</p>
<p>　　3) 如果动词在不同选项之间分别是从句与主句的谓语，要注意句子结构是否完整，选项是否有主句。</p>
<p>　　A. 正确。</p>
<p>　　B. But作连词，连接的成分与谓语动词denounce平行，因此，supporting用法错误</p>
<p>　　C. say…语法上与denounce并列，中间应该有连词连接，可以改为saying，或者在say之前加and; at the same time位置错误。</p>
<p>　　D. 句子结构不完整，没有主句;supporting…与前面的saying之间缺少连词。</p>
<p>　　E. 句子结构不完整，没有主句;supporting…在语法上与denouncing并列，缺少连词。</p>
<p>　　句子结构：A recent poll indicates that…; i.e., they denounce…, saying…, while supporting… 句子使用了分号，将长句分隔成了两个相对独立的分句，两分句不存在从属关系，属于同一层次的句 子。在后半句中，they denounce big government while at the same time supporting….为主结构， saying现在分词作伴随状语考点:</p>
<p>　　句子结构(Grammatical Construction)while + 现在分词表达时间状语的方式; 功能相同的并列结构需要由连词连接。补充说明:1) i.e. 的作用在于给出之前提到的事物的具体的解释、说明，在汉语中起到"也就是说"、"也就是"的 含义。</p></div>
