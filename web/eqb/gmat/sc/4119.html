    —they are often green and striped，or have plenty of bumps and bruises—heirlooms are more flavorful and thus in increasing demand.
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4119" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Although appearing less appetizing than most of their round and red supermarket cousins, heirloom tomatoes, grown from seeds saved during the previous year</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4119" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Although heirloom tomatoes, grown from seeds saved during the previous year, appear less appetizing than most of their round and red supermarket cousins</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4119" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Although they appear less appetizing than most of their round and red supermarket cousins, heirloom tomatoes, grown from seeds saved during the previous year</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4119" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Grown from seeds saved during the previous year, heirloom tomatoes appear less appetizing than most of their round and red supermarket cousins</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4119" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Heirloom tomatoes, grown from seeds saved during the previous year, although they appear less appetizing than most of their round and red supermarket cousins</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_4119" value="B"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span>A项，前面appearing 部分是修饰H tomato，后面grown部分也是修饰H tomato。这样 although的半句话，主语是H tomato，没有谓语。</span><br><br><span>B项正确，although H tomato，grown部分做修饰主语，apper部分做谓语表达不好看含义，they are 部分做H tomato不好看的补充说明。</span><br><br><span>C项一样，一是they和 H tomato太远，二是与A一样的问题，没有谓语</span></p>
<p><span><span>BD的最大问题要关注划线外的部分 heirlooms are more flavorful and thus in increasing demand 所以D就无法将 heirloom tomatoes 再作为主语来使用</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>这题可以根据原句划线外的暗示 一个是：—they are often green 另一个是：—heirlooms are more flavorful and thus in increasing demand 对于第一处暗示 可以杀掉AC 而DE都出现了主语 所以杀</span></span></span></p>
