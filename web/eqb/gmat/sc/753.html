    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：The government predicts that, for consumers and businesses that …, the FCC's recent telephone rate cuts will greatly reduce costs, though…, suggesting....</p>
<p>　　主句主语是the government，谓语predict，后跟that引导宾语从句说明predict的内容。从句主语是rate cuts，谓语是reduce。Though引导状语从句，suggesting是现在分词短语作伴随状语修饰disagree。</p>
<p>　　考点：逻辑表达、句子结构</p>
<p>　　逻辑表达，介词短语的位置不能随意改变，否则会使修饰对象改变，产生歧义。</p>
<p>　　句子结构，在主从复杂句子中要注意主句和从句的主谓结构是否齐全，常见的错误选项是缺少主句谓语。</p>
<p>　　(A) 正确，for…指“对…而言”。</p>
<p>　　(B) cost be reduced by…，被动语态表达不清晰。</p>
<p>　　(C) 名词prediction不及动词表达更确切;被动语态表达不清晰。</p>
<p>　　(D) 句子主语是prediction，缺少谓语;介词短语for…修饰对象错误，应该是修饰FCC，而不是the government。</p>
<p>　　(E) 介词短语for…修饰对象错误，that引导定语从句修饰rate cuts不及直接用’s rate cuts简洁。</p></div>
