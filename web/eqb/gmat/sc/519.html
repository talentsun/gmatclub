    Discussion of greenhouse effects has usually focused on whether the earth would warm and by how much, but climatologists have indicated all along that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the most obvious effects, and those that would have the largest impact on people, would be extremes of temperature, precipitation, and storminess</span>.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>不可否认 5个选项很难比出来 但是看一看出 a明显比 b c d e 简洁</p>
