<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：Sulfur dioxide, … , is…pollutant because it diminishes…ability to deal with… </span>
</h3>
<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>习惯用语（idiom） 句子结构（grammatical construction）</h4>
<ol><li> capability of doing/capability to do；GMAT认为capability of X-ing是wordy/awkward的。</li>

<li> ability：sb's ability to do sth或ability of sb/sth to do sth</li>
<li> capability to do/of doing/in doing不如ability to do简洁，但不可就此判错。</li>
</ol><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Correct；ability to deal使用简洁；respiratory system's ability可以。</li>
<li>B. because of后结构复杂，awkward；capability of dealing不够简洁。</li>

<li>C. in dealing有做状语修饰整个从句的歧义，含义变为Sulfur dioxide在dealing with的时候减少了respiratory system的能力，而不是原义想要表达的，减少了respiratory system的deal with…的能力；Capability如果后面要加in doing,最好紧跟Capability，避免歧义。</li>

<li>D. especially强调严重性，specially强调特殊性，根据原义，选especially；of the respiratory system的插入，导致to deal可以修饰动词diminish，歧义。</li>
<li>E. especially强调严重性，specially强调特殊性，根据原义，选especially； because of错误同B。</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<ol><li> specially 和especially区别（记住这种小点，有益于快速解题）</li>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Especially</span> is most often used to emphasize something, or to say that something is more worth mentioning or more important than the other things you are talking about: It can be especially difficult for drivers to see cyclists at night. | The town is especially crowded in the summer (=much more than in winter). I hate interruptions, especially when I'm trying to work (=I do not mind as much at other times).<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Specially</span> is usually used when you do something that is different from what you usually do for a particular purpose. It is often used with the passive form of a verb: a specially made/designed/adapted etc car | I bought it specially for you<br>即：<br>especially强调严重性，specially强调特殊性！<br>especially是表示程度<br>specially表示特殊<br><li> capability和ability区别：ability to do和capability to do区别，在强调某人/物天生具有某种能力用ability好，capability可能强调的是能不能做某事（跟天生没什么关系），如government'capability或transport system's capability等。1) If we don't take great care, SARS could become established in the poorest nations - places like Burundi, Nigera or Malawi - which have neither the high-tech capability of Toronto nor the totalitarian muscle of China to contain it<br>2) capability of sth. to be done表一种属性, 非一种主动的能力。<br>3) capability (of sth.）to do/of doing.</li>
<li> sth's ability可用在无生命主体:</li>
