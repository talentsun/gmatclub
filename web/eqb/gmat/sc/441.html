<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>逻辑意思（logical prediction） 平行结构（parallelism）</h4>

<ol><li> the amount of driving they do中的they do是定语从句，先行词the amount of driving在定从中做宾语省略that，还原也即do the amount of driving，类似于do a lot of homework/driving；在formal problem里出现这样"不太正式"的结构其实还是有点令人诧异的。</li>
<li> 比较结构中的省略。</li>

<li> Nor的相关用法：</li>

</ol><p>1) nor用在否定句中表示"也不"的意思</p>
<p>2) neither A nor B后面跟的谓语动词由B决定:</p>

<p>Neither we nor they want it. (来自AHD的例子)，说明由B决定的。</p>
<h4>再看两个来自jukuu的例子：</h4>
<ol><li>Neither menus nor dialog boxes have this immediate property. Each one requires an intermediate step, sometimes more than one.</li>
<li>Neither the salesman nor the supervisor has been notified of the sale.</li>

</ol><h4>另外单个neither的用法：</h4>

<p>They were not in Shanghai at that time. Neither (nor) were we.</p>
<p>They are not from England. Neither (nor) is she.</p>

<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. indicate后面是要说明的内容，所以最好用that引导一个定语从句；are making和have reduced不平行。</li>
<li>B. indicate错误同A；having done是非谓语动词中现在分词的完成式，使得从句没有谓语动词。</li>
<li>C.<span style="font-weight: bold;">there are表示自然存在或统计数据，用在此处并不合适(记住一些有效性错误，能加速筛选选项)</span>； having made和have reduced不平行。</li>

<li>D. and前后不平行，并且后面半句变成了few people are not making…于原句意思相悖；and在否定句中是"或"的意思。</li>

<li>E.correct；made前省略了have，have reduced和have made平行，也即<span style="font-weight: bold;">两个平行的过去分词可以共享同一个助动词have</span>；由于宾语从句由few引导是一个否定含义的句子，所以or表示"并"，而不是"或"。</li>

</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<p>在比较中助动词have也可以省略</p></div>
