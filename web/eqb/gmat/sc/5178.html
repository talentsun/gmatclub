    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A.scientist 不能做Never connected to a large land mass的主语。因此B也排除</p>
<p>C先说Hawaii, never connected to a large land mass,后面又说科学家怎么样，那hawaii是干啥的啊，显然不对，pass</p>
<p>D与E均符合主谓一致的原则，但D是被动表达，没有必要这么改，没有主动好！所以选E</p>
<p>ETS还是比较喜欢主动方式的，一般在选项里将主动改为被动，多数情况都不对</p></div>
