    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　A. 正确。</p>
<p>　　B. Determining要求a group of scientists为句子主语。</p>
<p>　　C. Determining要求a group of scientists为句子主语;过去完成时态使用错误。</p>
<p>　　D. Determining要求a group of scientists为句子主语;what从句与 the levels of…不平行。</p>
<p>　　E. what从句与 the levels of…不平行;were that were present in core samples笨拙且结构不清晰。</p>
<p>　　句子结构：After determining A and B, a group of scientists was able to…. 该句中，A and B要求平行对称：A为the levels of …，因此，B应该为the types of …。 由于现在分词位于句首其逻辑主语应该和句子的主语一致，因此，句子主语只能是a group of scientists。</p>
<p>　　考点:逻辑表达(Logical Predication), 平行对称(Parallelism), 动词形式(Verb Form) 现在分词位于句首作状语时，其逻辑主语是句子主语。the levels of… 需与 the types of… 平行对称 过去完成时的使用首先要有明确的时间点进行提示，第二要合理的体现出"已经完成"的含义</p>
<p>　　补充说明:请读者注意本题的主谓搭配：a group of scientists was able to…. 集合名词做主语，包括team、group等，谓语用单数。</p></div>
