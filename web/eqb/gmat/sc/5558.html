    The manager at the office supply store believes that the new CLP-300 laserjet printer will be used <span style="text-decoration:underline;">more as a replacement for printers in small offices and libraries rather than for high quality and feature-packed machines in large company settings because its noise emission, only 43 decibels, is far less than most</span> other laserjet printers, which make about 50 decibels of noise each.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A 中 more as a replacement for printers in small offices and libraries rather than for high 。more as that (as)sth 而不能跟for 对应。</p>
<p>B 我把quieter 当成A中的far less than 了 看了半天觉得没一个对的，，，</p>
<p>C中 far less thant 是形容 emission 的，不能跟后面的打印机修饰 所以错了。</p>
<p>D ，E </p>
<p>中 it is for other laserjet printers 。it 指代的是什么，不管指代哪个 句子都不通顺，如果指代emission 应该用of 而不是for ....</p></div>
