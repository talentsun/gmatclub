    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：The period …. has been established….., but what is much more difficult to determine is ………..</span></h3>
<p>旧石器时代的人居住在位于Lascaux 与Altamira的巨大的壁画洞的时期已经通过碳测时法确认，但更难确定的是原始人使用什么工具开凿石洞，为什么他们要装饰以及这些华丽的被描绘出的动物所代表的含义。</p>
<p>主语：The period，谓语动词：be establish, 完成时态符合逻辑，when引导时间状语从句修饰主语。but 引导并列句子，what引导主语从句，谓语动词为be difficlut的比较形式，use ,reason, meaning并列做该部分宾语。</p>
<h3>考点</h3>
<p>主谓一致：</p>
<ol><li>what引导的名词性从句中从句谓语动词的单复数情况：what后面"什么时候用单数,什么时候用复数"根据动词后面的名词的单复数来定.</li>
<li>what引导的名词性从句做主语时，主句谓语动词的单复数情况：</li>
</ol><p>(1)What在从句中做主语，<span style="font-weight: bold;">主句谓语</span>由what从句谓语决定。</p>
<p>What he'd like most for a birthday present is a camera.</p>
<p>(2)what在从句中做宾语，<span style="font-weight: bold;">主句谓语</span>由<span style="font-weight: bold;">主句表语/宾语</span>决定what they want are XX,XX&amp;XX。</p>
<p>What his father left him are a few English books.</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>(A) but后分句谓语应该用单数形式is。</li>
<li>(B) Correct</li>
<li>(C) The period和have主谓不一致; that which=what，用what更为简洁。</li>
<li>(D) The period和have主谓不一致；but后分句谓语应该用单数形式is。</li>
<li>(E) The period和are主谓不一致; 随意改变句子时态，完成时变现在时。that which 相当于一个从句中两个主语，题目释义错误。</li>
</ul><p>生词</p>
<p>carbon dating 碳(14)测定年代（名词）</p>
<h3>补充说明</h3>
<ol><li>以who, why, how, whether或that引导主语从句，谓语动词用单数例：Why she did this is not known.</li>
