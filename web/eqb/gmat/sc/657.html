    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 平行对称(Parallelism)</p>
<p>　　1) not…but结构要平行</p>
<p>　　2) which不能指代前面整个句子</p>
<p>　　3) as be the case比较结构。</p>
<p>　　(A) was produced not by… but university结构不平行; which使用错误,不能指代前面整个句子</p>
<p>　　(B) was produced not by… but university结构不平行; the case with…插入语表达模糊</p>
<p>　　(C) 正确, was produced not by… but by结构平行; as was the case…插入语中as指代前面整个句子, as was the case表明后者是前面概述的一个情况,意思表达完整.</p>
<p>　　(D) was not produced by…, but was produced by结构不平行; which使用错误</p>
<p>　　(E) was not produced by…, but by结构不平行; the case with…插入语表达模糊</p>
<p>　　句子结构: A.. papaya was produced not by…,as was the case with…, but by…</p>
<p>　　补充说明:读题的时候看到前面出现了not by立刻往后扫至到看到but为止,如果not…but结构不平行,则可以直接 跳过该选项,从而节省做题时间.</p></div>
