    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>根据题目的意思，brightening of the northern light 和 knocking out of a satellite 是有关联的（同时发生的）所以他们的动词时态也应该是相同的。</p>
<p>A. brightening 和 knocking 时态不同</p>
<p>B. X was what triggered Y 不简洁，后面的两个 and...and...也很不简洁。并且 earth 后的逗号把后面的句子分割成了一个独立的句子，改变了原题的意思。</p>
<p>C. 正确</p>
<p>D. "a cloud ejected from te sun" 这句话在D选项中竟然莫名其妙的不见了，改变了题目的意思，错的离谱了。</p>
<p>E. 同D</p></div>
