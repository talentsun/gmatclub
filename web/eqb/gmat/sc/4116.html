    While it costs about the same to run nuclear plants as other types of power plants, it is the fixed costs that stem from building nuclear plants that makes it more expensive for them to generate electricity.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A This sentence uses the emphatic structure <i>it is … that</i> without justification. The singular verb <i>makes</i> violates the agreement within the structure. The verb <i>makes</i> should agree with the notional subject (<i>the fixed costs</i>), not with the pronoun <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>B Correct. This answer choice clearly and succinctly compares the two types of costs<i>.</i></p>
<p>C In addition to using the more cumbersome emphatic structure, this version violates the agreement within the structure. The verb should agree with the notional subject (<i>the fixed costs</i>), not with the pronoun <i>it</i>.</p>
<p>D The preposition <i>for</i> is redundant in comparing the two objects of <i>run</i>. Since it is not clear what <i>stemming … </i>refers to, this is a dangling modifier.</p>
<p>E<i> </i>The passive construction <i>electricity … is made more expensive because of … </i>is wordy and cumbersome. The preposition<i>for</i> is necessary in the comparison of the costs.</p></div>
