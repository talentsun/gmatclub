    <div class="explanation" style="display:none">句子结构：Scientists believe that…, … male moths… call female moths… using…, rather than…, and attract their mates... That引导宾语从句说明believe的内容，从句主语是male whistling moths，并列谓语是call and attract， 现在分词结构using…作伴随方式状语。OG10解释：Choice D, the best answer, is concise, maintains parallel structure, and clearly conveys the comparisons being made between the two types of moth.  In A and E, the comparison between most male moths and the male whistling moth is not clear. The use of but not does not clearly convey that most other moths use olfactory signals; rather than" would be preferable, as well as parallel to rather than at night.   In A, the phrase by the use of is unnecessarily wordy, and the insertion of they is not required.In E, the final verb should be attract (parallel to call), not attracting (parallel to using).Choice B violates parallelism with by the use of... instead of using, as well as with call... and  attracting.Choice C distorts the meaning of the original with its suggestion that male whistling moths call female moths to them both by using acoustical signals and by attracting their mates during the day. The insertion of using in not using olfactory ones is unnecessary.</div>
