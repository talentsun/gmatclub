    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>1. not x but y is the correct idiom. X and Y should be parallel.<br>
Only C is parallel with "not that .... but rather that"<br><br>
2. Usage of like vs As<br><br>
So answer is C<br><br>
Choice E should follow pattern "is not x but rather y"<br>
"is not x but it is y" is incorrect<!-- google_ad_section_end --> </p>
<p>ANOTHER ANSWERï¼š</p>
<p>First <br>
IDIOMS<br><br>
not x , but Y where X and Y are parallel <br><br>
not x , but rather Y where x and y are parallel <br><br>
please note that Rather is optional <br><br>
I would remember it as <br>
Not X , but (rather) y<br>
------------------------------<br>
wrong ones <br><br>
not x, but instead y<br><br>
eliminate a and D <br>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>
Like vs as <br><br>
babu has done a good job here <br><br>
Eliminate b and d<br><br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>
C vs E<br>
not that the position it takes is heretical, as some have asserted, but rather that it is <br><br>
E that the position it takes is not heretical, as some have asserted it to be, but rather it is <br><br>
E has parallelism issues <br><br>
as some have asserted " it " to be is grammatically correct <br><br>
However , wordy <br></p></div>
