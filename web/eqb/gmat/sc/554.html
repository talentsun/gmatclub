    Over the next few years, increasing demands on the Chattahoochee River, which flows into the Apalachicola River, could alter the saline content of Apalachicola Bay, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">which would rob the oysters there of their flavor, and to make them decrease in size</span>, less distinctive, and less in demand.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>看完Ａ立马杀掉　ＷＨＩＣＨ指代对象不对</p>
<p>Ｂ中的ＩＴ并列不对吧　指哪个？</p>
<p>Ｃ看过去还行　往下看　发现ＤＥ很像　而ＣＤＥ开头形式不同　那就先往此处想想　如果是Ｃ则与 alter 并列　句意上还行　如果是robbing则increasing demands 作为主语句意也说的通　再往后比比看　Ｄand making them smaller　而ＣＥ是 decrease in size　这猜都是Ｄ好　</p></div>
