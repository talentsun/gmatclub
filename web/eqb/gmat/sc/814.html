    Pioneered by scientists at Los Alamos National Laboratory, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">BEAM robots are not programmed to walk; instead they use brainlike circuits called neural networks to learn to walk through trial and error</span>.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　A. 正确。</p>
<p>　　B. Instead of by programming them的主语为BEAM robots，机器人自己不能为自己编程，该句逻 辑含义不通</p>
<p>　　C. 现在进行时的被动语态使but后面的using…与其并列，逻辑意思不合理。</p>
<p>　　D. 句首的分词结构修饰对象错误。</p>
<p>　　E. 名首的分词结构修饰对象错误。句子结构：Pioneered by…, BEAM robots are not programmed…; instead they use…</p>
<p>　　考点:逻辑表达(Logical Predication), 动词形式(Verb Form) 分词结构在句首，修饰对象为主句主语。be being done为现在进行时的被动语态</p></div>
