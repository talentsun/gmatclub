    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A is the best</li>
<li>B，句首分词与后面主句主语不一致</li>
<li>C，with it skimming不好，笨重</li>
<li>D，because of its skimming表达不简洁</li>
<li>E，句意改变，makes it possible that表达不简洁</li>
</ul><p>注意本题的A选项不存在夹心修饰的问题，因为by skimming along the top of the atmosphere插入在could 和fly之间，只能做状语修饰谓语动词，而没有办法做定语修饰主语。</p>
<p>要注意这里by和because of 意思上的细微差别。</p></div>
