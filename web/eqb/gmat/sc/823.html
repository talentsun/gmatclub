    <div class="explanation" style="display:none">A. Unlike引起的比较，比较对象不对等B. Unlike引起的比较，比较对象不对等C. Unlike引起的比较，比较对象不对等D. 进行时态错误；which引导的从句修饰highlands，谓语应为复数；use its strategic position in doing  something习语使用错误。E. 正确。句子结构：Canc??n seems to have used… to become…. A source of A, B, and C为同位语，修饰its strategic position at the foot of the highlands.考点:比较（Comparison）, 动词形式（Verb Form）, 习惯用语（Idiom）Unlike引起比较，要求比较对象对等。 句子描述关于玛雅人的事情，描述客观事实可以直接采用一般现在时，to be doing，强调进行的 概念，to have done，强调过去的行为。use something to do something为正确的习语，不定式to表目的，朗文的解释为：to take advantage of a situation</div>
