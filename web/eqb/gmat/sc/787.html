    <div class="explanation" style="display:none">句子结构：Like navigators who…, astronomers have made observations that… 比较结构。 Like连接navigators和astronomers对比，现在分词结构gathering…作sailed的伴随状语。考点：比较比较，like连接比较对象要对等，just as A do, so B do的固定搭配。(A) like连接比较对象不对等，navigators与observations。(B) like连接比较对象不对等，navigators与observations；表目的用不定式优于for doing结构。(C) 用where引导定语从句改变了原句意思，原句并没有说明gather information是在Earth；similar to 放在句首永远错,应该用Like替换(D) 正确，navigators与astronomers对比。(E) just as with搭配错误。</div>
