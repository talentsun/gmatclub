<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>句子结构，构词，修辞结构</h4>
<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. Correct。</li>
<li>B. "(just) as+从句, +主句"的结构中，主句与从句要尽可能形式对称，故that应该紧跟convinced；would若是用在现在时态则表示不确定性，若是表示过去时态则文中没有暗示是过去时，故错误。</li>
<li>C. 现在分词短语作定强调动作的多次性、重复性和客观性，无明确时间概念，而买票通常只是一次性概念；are convinced后加that；prefer A as compared to B错误，prefer A to B是正确词组。</li>
<li>D. Despite the fact that不简洁，despite后面应该直接加让步的内容；文中说尽管数字增长而不是尽管某些事实; -ing分词短语作定强调动作的多次性、重复性和客观性, 无明确时间概念，purchasing表示不停买东西的人不合理；that应该在convinced后面；prefer A to B是正确词组。</li>
<li>E. Despite the fact that不简洁； the number of people是单数，are应该改为is；prefer … compared with…错，应该用prefer A to B。</li>
