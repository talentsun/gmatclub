    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：… Barbara Wootton noted as… that the elephant that… was earning…</p>
<p>　　Note that… as…因为that从句较长，所以移到句子后面。</p>
<p>　　OG10解释：</p>
<p>　　Choice A, the best answer, uses the idiomatic construction noted... that and clearly focuses on the salient information-- a comparison of annual earnings.</p>
<p>　　In B, the structure of noted... that the elephant, giving rides ..., had been earning falsely implies that the reader already knows about the elephant--that is, that the existence of this particular elephant is not new information. Also, the past perfect had been improperly places the elephant's earning in the past, prior to Wootton's; consistent verb tense is needed to show that the actions are simultaneous.</p>
<p>　　Choice C may be faulted for distortion of meaning and diminished clarity because it suggests that the point of Wootton's example was the elephant's very existence; comparative earnings are presented (after and) as incidental detail.</p>
<p>　　Choice D is awkward and inexact; the whole circumstance that Wootton "noted" is best expressed in a clause that begins with that.</p>
<p>　　Choice E does not use the idiomatic construction noted that x; therefore, and that it earned has no parallel construction to which it can be joined.</p></div>
