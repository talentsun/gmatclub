    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A正确</p>
<p>B have been found时态不对，直接用过去时即可。where first discovered会让人误解不知道什么东西first discovered所以最好加上主谓，where they were first discovered 。pear points后面应该加with表示描述带有纵向沟痕的。</p>
<p>C还是Have been discovered的时态问题。改成were discovered。pear points后面应该加with表示描述带有纵向沟痕的。</p>
<p>D even though 和but都表示转折，重复。转移了句子重心。</p>
<p>E have been first discovered wrong tense..while不能代替although/even though..</p></div>
