    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　句子结构：Joachim Raff and Giacomo Meyerbeer are … who…, but whose reputation declines… and never regains…</p>
<p>　　Who与whose引导并列的定语从句修饰名词composer，前一从句谓语是receives，后一从句的并列谓语是declines and regains。</p>
<p>　　OG10解释：</p>
<p>　　Choice C, the best answer, maintains parallel structure, keeps verb tense consistent, and contains no redundancies.</p>
<p>　　Choice A illogically suggests that it is the composer who goes into decline after death, rather than the composer's reputation. Choice A may also be faulted for the redundancy of never regains ... again.</p>
<p>　　Choice B is not correct. Grammatically, a coordinating conjunction (e.g., "but") is needed to join the clause whose reputation declines ... with the preceding clause, who receives popular acclaim.... Furthermore, the phrase never regains... again suffers from redundancy.</p>
<p>　　Choices D and E suffer from inconsistency in verb tense. To maintain parallelism the verbs must be receives... declines... regains.</p>
<p>　　OG11解释：</p>
<p>　　Verb tense + Parallelism</p>
<p>　　Faulty parallelism in the relative clause who receives ... goes ... regains ... makes it unclear who or what is being described. The original clause begins by describing a certain kind of composer. As written, with who as the subject of goes and regains, the last two descriptions illogically continue to refer to the kind of composer. Logically it must be the reputation that declines after the composer's death.</p>
<p>　　A Illogically suggests the composer goes into decline after death; redundant again</p>
<p>　　B The two clauses are not parallel, lack a coordinating conjunction, and do not describe the same thing; redundant again</p>
<p>　　C Correct. This sentence presents the proper logic while maintaining parallel structure and consistent verb tense.</p>
<p>　　D The verb tenses are inconsistent with present tense used in the first phrase; redundant again</p>
<p>　　E The verb tenses are inconsistent with present tense used in the first phrase; to maintain parallelism, the verbs must be receives ... declines ... regains</p>
<p>　　The correct answer is C.</p></div>
