    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>考点</h3>
<p>逻辑表达（Logical Predication） 句子结构（Grammatical Construction） 习惯用语（Idiom） 省略结构一定要能够还原appoint是及物动词,后面直接加职务名词（双宾语）: appointed her the chief operating officer of the company</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>(A) Abigail Adams or Dolly Madison ever had been结构中,had been省略结构无法还原, 也就是说 had been无法承接she shattered进行省略</li>
<li>(B) President Harry S Truman作为after a career as First Lady的逻辑主语,不符合逻辑.</li>
<li>(C) never matched in the case of Abigail Adams or Dolly Madison结构表达复杂; President Harry S Truman作为after a career as First Lady的逻辑主语,不符合逻辑.</li>
<li>(D) 正确, 句子结构简洁; Eleanor Roosevelt作为after a career as First Lady的逻辑主语; 符合逻辑, appoint使用符合习惯用法</li>
<li>(E) in the case of Abigail Adams or of Dolly Madison's结构复杂, 且所有格指代不清; appoint属于及 物动词,后面直接加名词</li>
</ul><p>     句子结构: … after a career as First Lady in which she shattered…, Eleanor Roosevelt was appointed…</p></div>
