<div class="question" id="question_5660">
    Pumps A, B, and C operate at their respective constant rates. Pump A and B, operating simultaneously, can fill a certain tank in 6/5 hours; pumps A and C, operating simultaneously, can fill the tank in 3/2 hours; and pumps B and C, operating simultaneously, can fill the tank in 2hours. How many hours does it take pumps A, B, Coperating simultaneously, to fill the tank?

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span>If A and B can fill a tank in 6/5 hour, then their rate, together, is 5/6 tank/hour rate (1 tank = rate * 6/5 hour). If you do that (convert to a rate instead of time) for all of the pump configurations, you get the following: </span><br><br><span>A + B = 5/6 </span><br><span>A + C = 2/3 </span><br><span>C + B = 1/2 </span><br><br><span>When you solve for the variables, you get the following rates, in tank/hour: </span><br><br><span>A = 1/2 </span><br><span>B = 1/3 </span><br><span>C = 1/6 </span><br><br><span>When the tanks work together, they will fill 1 tank/hour and therefore the answer is [E]. It's worth noting that you still need to solve the W = rate * time equation to get the answer, it just solves easily: </span><br><br><span>Work of 1 tank = 1 tank/hour * time </span><br><br><span>Time = 1 hour </span></p></div>
