<div class="question" id="question_5618">
    In a state of pure commercial competition, there would be a large number of producing firms, all unfettered by governmental regulations, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">all seeking to meet consumer needs and wants more successfully than each other</span>.
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5618" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>all seeking to meet consumer needs and wants more successfully than each other</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5618" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>all seeking more successfully to meet consumer needs and wants than the others</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5618" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>each seeking to meet consumer needs and wants more successfully than one another</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5618" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>each seeking to meet consumer needs and wants more successfully than the others</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_5618" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>each seeking more successfully to meet consumer needs and wants than another</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_5618" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>"than one another"?  should better be "one... than another..."</p>
<p>but on E, to seek successfully to meet ≠ to seek to meet successfully</p>
<p>"one... the others..." is correct. </p></div>
