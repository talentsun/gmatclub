    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>考点一，谓语——以及引申出来的平行结构。 划线部分前面是Forest主语，因此需要选一个谓语。CDE谓语明确是covered，A被枪毙，B企图用accommodated做谓语，但中间直接夹一个定语从句（Which+be<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">省略）的结构，属于定语从句，其句子复杂度比直接使用简单句要高，句子容量较低，CDE优选；B较不优，A排除。紧接着看出现了第二个动词Accommodate，因此And带出的并列句需要主语一致，平行对称，所以BE被枪毙。</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">剩下CD，考点二，句子复杂度。划线部分前面考完了，考后面。后面的两个动词明确指出修饰的是一个动物，不是forest，因为Forest不能家养domesticate. 对于所修饰的elephants, C用了介宾结构作状语，D用了重申修饰对象的定语从句。介宾结构在语法上首先认为是修饰主语谓语，但这里的a third又不是修饰a forest，所以错了。重申修饰对象的定语从句是大师句式，优选。</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">如果还不能排除C 可以从a third的指代对象是否明确入手。with 结构，其修饰可以是全句的主语，forest，也可以就近修饰elephants，所以会造成歧义，排除。</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">综上，无论如何都选D<br></span></p></div>
