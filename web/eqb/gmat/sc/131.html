<h3>考点</h3>

<h4>逻辑意思（logical prediction） 平行结构（parallelism）</h4>
<p>whereas/while这种连词连接的比较成分不要求形式上绝对的平行，当然形式上也平行是最好的。</p>
<p>they, their, it都是完整指代，即指代包含了被指对象的所有修饰成分</p>
<p>**注意仅仅是修饰词，如：</p>
<p>In Japan <span style="font-weight: bold;">elderly people</span> are treated with far greater respect than <span style="font-weight: bold;">they</span> are in most Western countries.如果前面的elderly people没有其他修饰，后面时可以用they来指代的。</p>

<p>one和that，those是核心词指代。</p>
<p>that , one , it 的区别见补充说明。</p>
<p>compared with直接跟在逗号后面可以修饰逗号前面的名词：</p>
<p>Example：</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">In the United States, while the number of foreign-born residents and their children is higher than ever, the percentage of the population they represent is not; in 1910 this group made up </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">35 percent of the population, compared with 20 percent</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> in 2000.</span>
<br><p>Compared with也可以修饰前面整个分句：</p>

<p>Example:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Today, </span></p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">more than 43 percent </span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">of Californians under the age of eighteen are Hispanic,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> compared with about 35 percent</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> a decade ago.</span>

<br><span style="font-style: italic;">In the United States, </span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Fifty-two percent</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> of high school graduates go on to college, compared with </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">thirty-five percent</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;"> in Canada and fifteen percent in Great Britain, Japan, and West Germany.</span>
<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">One baby in four</span>

<span style="font-style: italic;"> is now born to a mother aged thirty or older, </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">compared with just one in six</span>

<span style="font-style: italic;"> in 1975.</span>
<br><p>as compared to/with：</p>
<span style="font-style: italic;">A recent review of pay scales indicates that, on average, CEO's now earn </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">419 times the pay of blue-collar workers, as compared to 42 times their pay</span>

<span style="font-style: italic;">, the ratio in 1980.</span>

<br><p>由此可见，as compared to和compared with在用法上没有什么区别。</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>A. it完整指代75 percent of the energy produced in France，意思错误；在比较成分前后都是句子的情况下，前面分句是主谓宾结构表达动作，后面分句是主系表结构表达状态，功能上不平行，错误。</li>
<li>B. 也是energy和Germany的比较错误；33 percent所指代的事物不明确。</li>
<li>C. Correct；前后都是主谓宾结构；介词短语充当地点状语前后对称，位置正确；比较了法国和德国各自的来自于核能的能量。</li>
<li>D. 由于in Germany位置变成了修饰nuclear power，就变成了"在法国，超过33%的能量来自于德国生产的核能"；同时失去了比较的意味, 所以这里用whereas是没意义的。</li>

<li>E. it指代75 percent of the energy produced in France，意思错误；nuclear power和energy from nuclear power比较，范围错误。</li>

</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>
<h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">that , one , it 的区别--aeoluseros:</span>

</h4>
<p>I. it／one ／that三者均可用作代词, 指代前面提到的名词。一般说来, it指代同名同物; one与that则指代同名异物。</p>
<p>I have lost my umbrella; I'm looking for it. （该句中it就是指前面的my umbrella）</p>
<p>I have lost my umbrella; I think I must buy one. （one在该句中表泛指, 因为my umbrella已经丢了）</p>

<p>The umbrella you bought is cheaper than that I bought. （替代词that在该句中特指"the umbrella I bought", 以区别"the umbrella you bought"）</p>
<p>II. one与that虽可用来指代同名异物, 但one为泛指, 相当于a／an＋名词; that为特指, 相当于the ＋名词。所以one所指代的名词的修饰语一般为 a／an ／some ／any; that所指代的名词的修饰语往往是the ／this ／that。</p>

<p>A chair made of steel is stronger than one made of wood. （该句中one可以换成a chair）</p>
<p>The water in the cup is hotter than that in the pot. （该句中that可以换成 the water）</p>
<p>III. one只能代替可数名词单数, 代替可数名词复数时用ones; that既可以代替不可数名词也可以代替可数名词单数, 代替可数名词复数时用 those。</p>

<p>I like this pen more than that one. （one代替可数名词单数pen）</p>
<p>There were a few young people and some older ones in the house. （ones代替可数名词复数people）</p>
<p>Mary's handwriting is far better than that of Peter. （that代替不可数名词 handwriting）</p>

<p>These pictures are more beautiful than those. （those代替可数名词复数 pictures）</p>
<p>IV. one既可代替事物, 也可代替人, that只能代替事物而不能代替人。有时可以用the one或the ones代替that或those。</p>

<p>The one ／That on the table is mine. （该句中The one代替事物, 并且也可以用That）</p>
<p>He is the teacher, the one who is loved by the students. （该句中the one代替人, 不能用that）</p>
<p>He advised the farmers to choose the best seed-heads, the ones ／those that had the best color. （该句中the ones代替事物, 并且也可以用those）</p>
<p>V. one一般有前置修饰语, 有时也可有后置修饰语或不用修饰语。而 that不能有前置修饰语, 但可有后置修饰语。</p>

<p>Cook was a strict but good captain, one who took good care of his sailors.</p>
<p>The water in the well is cleaner than that in the river.</p>

<p>VI. it可以替代句中的不定式或从句等, 充当形式主语或形式宾语。one与that均无此用法。</p>
<p>It is known to everybody that the moon travels around the earth once every month.</p>

<p>I found it hard to get on with her.</p>
<p>VII. it与that均可以替代上文全句的内容或部分内容, 而one ／ones则不可以。</p>
<p>He has saved my life; I'll never forget it. （it代替第一分句）</p>
<p>Tom is painting his house. I am told he does it every four years. （it代替前面分句的部分内容painting his house）</p>
<p>Let's say we meet here at three o'clock. That ought to give you</p></div>
