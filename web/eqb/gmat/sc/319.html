<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：Very reluctant to have any extra weight ….., Charles Lindbergh refused to …….., despite…..…</span>
</h3>
<p>主语是Charles Lindbergh，形容词引导的不定式前置，修饰主语，谓语为refuse to do sth，despite引导的状语从句，修饰谓语，表转折。</p>
<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>句子结构</h4>

<p>Attempt的用法:</p>

<p>做及物动词时：</p>

<p>attempt to do sth.</p>
<p>attempt sth.</p>
<p>做名词时：</p>
<p>an attempt at (doing) sth.</p>
<p>an attempt to do sth. 但是不及attempt to do sth.简洁有效</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>

<ul><li>(A) 缺少连词，两套主谓结构，注意therefore是副词，不能做连词用；for引出目的状语逻辑不够合理，时间状语即可。</li>

<li>(B) being多余；being very reluctant to引导的成分夹心修饰。</li>

<li>(C) since和so语意重复，且两句话两个连词错误。；</li>
<li>(D) 句式结构复杂，clumsy&amp;awkward。</li>
<li>(E) Correct。</li>
</ul><h3>补充说明</h3>

<p>放下对despite的偏见：<span style="font-weight: bold;">despite后面既可以跟n.+长修饰语，也可以跟现在分词</span>。</p>
