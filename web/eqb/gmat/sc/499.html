    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A，被动语态不好，condensing逻辑主语如果是clouds，逻辑错误</li>
<li>B，which修饰对象错。可以这么用的，in the oceans是介词短语，可以跳过的</li>
<li>C is the best</li>
<li>D，which修饰对象错</li>
<li>E，which修饰对象错，form后多了as</li>
</ul><p>从句意理解，是water形成了clouds</p>
<p>C,E从开头一看就是比较舒服的结构，然后再仔细看两者的不同之处。</p></div>
