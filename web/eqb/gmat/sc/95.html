    The peaks of a mountain range, acting like rocks in a streambed, produce ripples in the air flowing over them; the resulting flow pattern, with <span style="text-decoration:underline;">crests and troughs that remain stationary although the air that forms them is moving rapidly, are</span> known as "standing waves".

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>此题体现了句意在SC中的应用 首先排除ABD 因为最后应该使用IS而不是ARE 然后比CE 最大的差别在句意上 E的确是简洁许多 但是用E的表达无法体现出crests and troughs 的stationary 和the air moving rapidly这种差别的对比 所以C更好些 虽然表述的比较冗余</p>
<p>sanitang说的非常有道理：只有C项的状语从句although真的起到了“状语”的作用，修饰的是remain这个谓语。E的although是一个名词直接加一个状语从句，不正确。</p>
<p>mercuureal：假如E改成with stationary crests and troughs, although which are formed ... 是不是就正确了呢……？</p></div>
