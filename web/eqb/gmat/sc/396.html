    In the sixteenth century, the push for greater precision in measuring time was <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not, like more recently, motivated by complicated philosophical questions about the nature of matter and the universe, but the practical matters of navigation</span>: sailors simply needed more highly accurate timepieces in order to compute their longitude from the positions of the stars.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span>A的not后面是个分词motivated，but后面是个动词matters，不对称。B有being，罗嗦。C的like后面应该加名词不应加句子，D也不对称。E的not和but后面都是by，对称。</span></p>
<p><span><span>like后面只能跟名词或者名词性短语，表示比较。 as指代前面一句话，还原即 The push for greater precision in measuring time was motivated by complicated philosophical questions about the nature of matter and universe has been the case more recently as指代前面整件事情, 而且as强调的是动作，like强调物体的性质</span><br></span></p></div>
