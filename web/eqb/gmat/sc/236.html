    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>首先发现ABC选项开头一样，先寻找这3个选项中的差异，先是发现were destroyed and（or） heavily damaged出现不同点，从意思上判断，肯定是选or，因为buildings被摧毁又怎么可能同时被严重损坏呢，这是不合逻辑的。按照这个原则先排除了AC。D选项将句子意思重心改变了，排除。E中Last year是显示整句的，与had been产生矛盾，不正确。所以得出答案B，使用had been是由于constructed in violation of the city's building cede这件事是在去年地震之前发生的，过去的过去应该使用过去完成时。</p></div>
