    Written in ink or engraved by stylus, more than 2,000 letters and documents on wooden tablets excavated at the site of the old roman fort at vindolanda in northern England are yielding a historical account of the military garrison in the first and second centuries that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">are so vivid in their details about personal life as they are</span> from Pompeii.

<p>从语义上看说的more than 2,000 letters and documents on wooden tablets 所形成的a historical account 像是从Pompeii 采集来的a historical account 一样生动。</p>
<p>之所以这样认为，不是将more than 2,000 letters and documents 进行比较，除了从语义上理解比较合适以外，倒数第二个that正满足了楼主心中“that就近修饰比较好”，就近修饰a historical account ，最后一个that当然是代词，指代a historical account 。</p></div>
