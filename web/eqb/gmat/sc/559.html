    After increasing steadily for centuries, the total annual catch of all wild <span style="text-decoration:underline;">fish peaked in 1989; since that time, the total catch for most species has declined or plateaued, prompting</span> conservation efforts designed to help prevent population crashes and possible extinctions.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>B中无端添加but，原句没有这种这种转折关系；since then 位置错，应放在the total catch  前面，declining or plateauing时态错，有since用现在完成时。in the case of most species 太wordy。</p>
<p>C中had没必要，不强调动作发生顺序；which prompted从句使句子没谓语了；且decline or plateau 名词不如动词表达有效</p>
<p>D中fish, which peaked in 1989，成了只修饰fish了，错；后面句子太awkward，明显不对</p>
<p>E中错误同D；且this 无指代对象</p></div>
