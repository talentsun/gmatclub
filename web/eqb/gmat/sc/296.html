<p>Choices A, B, and D inappropriately use the past tense verb <i>expressed;</i> only the present tense is logical here, since both the <i>current hostility</i> to which the <i>smokers</i> refer and the anxiety described in the clause <i>their prospects... are being stunted </i>clearly apply to the present. <i>（从未划线部分判断时态）</i></p>
<p>Furthermore, B, C, and D produce ungrammatical sentences by introducing this clause with the preposition <i>about;</i> the conjunction <i>that</i> is required to link <i>anxiety</i> with the clause that modifies it. <i>（that后引导一个句子）</i></p>
