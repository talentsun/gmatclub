<li>B. forming the mud or clay into bricks与to lay them不平行</li>
<li>C. having bricks formed from mud or clay, they were laid不平行</li>
<li>D. Correct。</li>

<li>E. Which指代错误，它无法跨越谓语动词指向bricks；一般过去时错误。</li>
</ul><p>OG12-11的解释</p>

<p>The purpose of the sentence is to describe the historically most popular method of building walls. The first clause announces this topic and the second clause describes the particular method. The clearest, most efficient way to accomplish these two pieces of business is to use a parallel structure.The <span style="font-style: italic;">ways to build</span> in the first clause is narrowed to the single way <span style="font-style: italic;">to form</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">to lay</span> in the second clause. There is no need to alternate the verb phrases between active and passive voice or to shift tenses.</p>

<ul><li>A. The active gerund phrase <span style="font-style: italic;">the forming of bricks </span>does not fi t with the passive verb phrase that follows (<span style="font-style: italic;">they are laid</span>).</li>

<li>B. The verb phrases <span style="font-style: italic;">forming the mud </span>… and <span style="font-style: italic;">to lay them </span>are not parallel.</li>
<li>C. In addition to faulty parallelism between <span style="font-style: italic;">having bricks formed </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">they were laid</span>, the tense in the second half of the sentence unaccountably shifts from present to past.</li>

<li>D.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Correct. </span>The phrases <span style="font-style: italic;">to form </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">to lay </span>in the second clause are parallel to <span style="font-style: italic;">to build </span>in the first clause.</li>

<li>E. The relative clause beginning with <span style="font-style: italic;">which </span>apparently (but nonsensically) describes the closest nouns, <span style="font-style: italic;">mud or clay</span>, rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">bricks</span>.</li>
