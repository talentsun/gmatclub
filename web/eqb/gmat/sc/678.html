    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>　　考点: 简洁有效(Rhetorical Construction)</p>
<p>　　1) 在句子中要注意意思相同的词或词组的重复使用</p>
<p>　　2) 尽量不要用动词的抽象名词形式,</p>
<p>　　3) 动词的现在分词形式做形容词一般含有正在进行的意思,而用过去分词形式做形容词一般表达其结果,表示动作已经完成</p>
<p>　　(A) annually和each year意思表达重复; improving表示动作的过程,而这里的逻辑意思应该是 performance已经被提高,其结果造成了$200 billion的收益</p>
<p>　　(B) annually和each year意思表达重复; and gain有和if they prevented并列的嫌疑; through worker performance improved…的重心在worker performance,因此不能准确的表达出原句的意思,应该将improved置于worker之前,使重心变为improved worker performance; by simply providing offices with cleaner air意思表达不清,没有表达出providing的施动者是谁</p>
<p>　　(C) 错误同B选项; in employee illness prevention表达笨拙,尽量不要用动词的抽象名词形式</p>
<p>　　(D) prevention表达笨拙; improving不如improved意思表达准确</p>
<p>　　(E) 正确, by preventing结构比in… prevention结构意思表达更清晰; 使用improved代替improving更符合逻辑意思</p>
<p></p>
<p>MercuuReal below:</p>
<p>Each year 出现还来一个Annually, 意群重复。D项那个<span>of workers if they simply provided会把they的指代混淆（companies/workers）.E正确</span></p>
<p><span>E项的save by preventing那么by preventing就是一个状语。我不读句意（谁爱读谁读）所以preventing到底是不是结果不在我判断的范围之内，反正语法上没有错误。<br></span></p></div>
