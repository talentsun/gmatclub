<h3>考点</h3>
<p>语法结构（grammatical construction） 逻辑意思（logical prediction）</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. 时态错误，前面是had reached adulthood，后面是have been attacked by，而事实上前者发生在后者的后面，时态混乱，而且人类在reach adulthood之后不会再有成长阶段，所以不应该用had reached adulthood，而应该用一般过去时，再者由于be attack发生在reach adulthood前面，所以有明显的时间对比，应该be attack用过去完成时had been attacked。</li>
<li>B. reach的时态错误，同时使得had been attacked没有时间对比来说明be attack是发生在过去的过去；Who引导的定语从句是非限制性修饰，使得逻辑含义错误。</li>
<li>C. correct；在第一次顺读句子的时候they虽然有向前指代attacks的倾向，但看到了reached adulthood，即可排除这个倾向，而判断they是向后指代men and women；本句把by the time放在宾语从句的最前面是最合理的，因为要强调一个截止的时间点。</li>
<li>D. that were可以省略，而且that仅用于指代非人类事物；were attacked和reach时态错误。</li>
<li>E. who were可以省略；adulthood后面少了逗号，错误，独立的修饰成分必须用两个逗号隔开；把by the time插在句子中间，显得很awkward。mercuuReal:"其实E项最大的问题在于时态，indicates表明所陈述的事实最好也是用这种时态的，可惜E没有。把时态改一下这句话是完全没有问题的。逗号不是语法现象"</li>
