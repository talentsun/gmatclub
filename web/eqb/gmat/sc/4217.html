<div class="question" id="question_4217">
    Whereas a ramjet generally cannot achieve high speeds without the initial assistance of a rocket, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">high speeds can be attained by scramjets, or supersonic combustion ramjets, in that they reduce</span> airflow compression at the entrance of the engine and letting air pass through at supersonic speeds.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>前后要平行，所以根据whereas后面要接scramjets，abc干掉。</p>
<p>对于ability,只有capability of doing 是gmat的偏爱，用ability的时候是ability to do,再者，明显E选项简洁有效。</p>
<p>看到从句，后面应该是主句，排除B</p>
<p>对应关系，选DE</p>
<p>有can 谁还用ability...E</p></div>
