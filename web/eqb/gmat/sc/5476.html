    Legislation in the Canadian province of Ontario requires of both public and private employers <span style="text-decoration:underline;">that pay be the same for jobs historically held by women as for jobs requiring comparable skill that are</span> usually held by men.

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A中，pay在这里作名词，表示“薪水”，require of sb that 名词+should（可省略）+动词原形/be。而且the same for ... as for ...结构对称。正确。</p>
<p>C中，付给...的钱，一般用pay ... for 来表示，这里用了pay ... in。而且 A of B 表示的是一种 A属于B的关系，jobs of comparable skill 表示jobs属于comparable skill，逻辑上不合理。</p>
<p>E中，一般是require sb. to do 这里用了require of sb. to do 不恰当。而且a job demanding comparable skills usually held by men，两个分词短语修饰job容易产生歧义，让人们不知道后一个held by men是修饰job的还是skills的。</p></div>
