<span style="font-weight: bold;">题目释义：The state has proposed new rules that …, rules intended to ensure that …   </span>

</h3>

<p>第二个rules做第一个rules的同位语。</p>
<h3>考点</h3>
<h4>题目释义  有效用词</h4>
<h4>1) 有效用词</h4>
<ol><li>intend的固定搭配： ? intend的动作发出者必须是生物。intend somebody to do sth.<br>intend doing sth.<br>intend to do/doing sth. （后面跟to do和ing都可以）<br>be intended to do sth.<br>intend that<br>be intended for somebody/something为正确的短语。表示书、电影、药品等等专门为…而设计或制造。</li>

<li>intent的固定搭配：noun. with intent (to do sth)</li>
<span style="font-style: italic;">He is charged with possession of a gun with intent to commit a robbery.</span>
<br>adj. be intent on/upon (doing) sth：  to be determined to do something or achieve something<br><span style="font-style: italic;">She was intent on pursuing a career in business.</span>
<br>intent on/upon  ?专注于<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Intent upon her work, she didn't notice the cold.</span>
<br>错误：intent of doing错<br><li>intention of doing sth.intention to do sth.错</li>

<li>ensure的固定搭配：</li>
</ol><p>ensure + n.</p>
<p>ensure + that (后面直接跟陈述语气，不跟should be)</p>
<p>错误：ensure sb. to do sth.</p>
<h4>2) 同位语结构的形式:  (参考白勇语法)</h4>
<ol><li>名词性同位语, 名词解释名词:n. , n. ; n. , a/an + n.或  a/an + n. , n.</li>
<li>that引导同位语结构:抽象名词(evidence, result, principle等等) + that从句, that从句对抽象名词进行具体化解释</li>

<li>概括性同位语结构:用一个概括性的名词去概括前面的解释对象; 短语/句子, a program/ an advance/ a practice that…</li>
<li>名词重复性同位语结构:</li>
</ol><p>n. , n.(重复所修饰的名词) + that… 或  n. , the same n.(重复所修饰的名词) that…</p>
<h3>选项分析</h3>
<ul><li>A. Correct；"four patients put through triage in a hospital emergency room"在医院急救室里被分为不同类的病人。</li>
<li>B. ①with the intent to do sth. 固定搭配；②ensure sth. / ensure that svo. 无ensure sb. to do/be done的用法；③at least修饰对象错误；④to be put through含义错误，分配护士的时候，病人应该是已经被分过级了，所以应该直接用put(过去分词)。</li>
<li>C. intending是rules的作者发出的而非rules，只能用A的intended to；ensure后面的宾语从句引导词that需要补出以使句式更为明晰；put through triage是紧随修饰patients的，不能被地点状语in a hospital emergency room隔开。</li>

<li>D. with the intent做伴随状语修饰前面的分句，逻辑主语不管为rules还是state都错误；with the intent to do sth.固定搭配；ensure已经有should的意思，后面不能用should be；that are put through triage修饰对象错误。</li>
<li>E. this不能指代前句；ensure sth. / ensure that svo. 无ensure sb. to do/be done的用法。</li>

<p>1) Asset allocators create portfolios, often in the form of of mutual funds, with the intention to turn in good results in both "bull" and "bear" markets.</p>
<ul><li>(A) with the intention</li>

<li>(C) intended</li>

<li>(D) and intending</li>

<li>(E) so intended as</li>
</ul><p>A. Longman确实有intention to do sth./have the intention of doing sth.但没有C简洁。</p>
<p>B. which指代不清。</p>
<p>C. Correct；这里的intended to是要修饰portforlios中间的often in the form of mutual funds是插入成分，prep中有很多这样的句子，搞一个插入成分把补语和所要修饰的词拆开迷惑人。</p>
<p>2) Alaska regularly deposits some of its profits from the sale of oil into a special fund, with the intention to sustain the state's economy after the exhaustion of its oil reserves.</p>
<ul><li>(A) fund, with the intention to sustain the state's economy after the exhaustion of its oil reserves</li>

<li>(B) fund, the intention of which is to sustain the state's economy after they have exhausted their oil reserves</li>
<li>(C) fund intended to sustain the state's economy after oil reserves are exhausted</li>

<li>(D) fund intended to sustain the state's economy after exhausting its oil reserves</li>
<li>(E) fund that they intend to sustain the state's economy after oil reserves are exhausted</li>

<p>3) prep2-128.</p>
<p>A Food and Drug Administration rule implemented in December 2000 mandates that any new drug that they intend to be used both by adults and children must undergo pediatric study and that its manufacturers list children's doses on the label.</p>

<ul><li>(A) drug that they intend to be used both by adults and children must</li>
<li>(B) drug whose intended use is for adults and children as well</li>
<li>(C) drug intended for use by both adults and children</li>

<li>(D) drug, if they intend that it be used by adults and also children, must</li>
<li>(E) drug, if intended for use both by adults and children, must</li>
</ul><ul><li>A. They没有指代对象；must和mandate词义重复，GMAT中mandate/order/suggest that somebody do something的结构，do要求使用原型，且动词do前面不加should、must等助动词和情态动词；both… and连接对象不平行。</li>

<li>B. Whose use is for…表达笨拙；as well的语义与and不同，drugs for adults and children as well，词组的重心和表达含义的重点在于药物适用于成人，同样适于儿童只是一个补充信息，而句子原意要表达的是同样适用于成人和儿童的药。</li>

<li>C. 正确</li>
<li>D. They没有指代对象；must和mandate词义重复，同A选项解释；both…and also搭配错误。</li>
<li>E. must和mandate词义重复，同A选项解释；both…and连接对象不平行。</li>
