    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>The parallel verbs are some PROPOSE (to combat), SUGGEST (reducing), and ARE CALLING (for X). All three verbs are in the present tense (although the third is in the present progressive, it's still considered present). If I could wave a wand, I would choose to make the third verb CALL, not ARE CALLING, but I don't have that option while retaining correct grammar in the rest of the sentence (e.g., in choice C, the expression "for decreasing" is definitely incorrect -- you must express the intended result of "reducing software prices" with an INFINITIVE such as "to decrease").</p></div>
