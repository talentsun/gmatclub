<div class="question" id="question_5671">
    Every photograph, because it involves the light rays that something emits hitting film, must in some obvious sense be true。But because it could always have been made to show things differently than it does, it cannot express the whole truth and, in that sense, is false.Therefore, nothing can ever be definitively proved with a photograph.
