     On a certain day, orangeade was made by mixing a certain amount of orange juice with an equal amount of water. On the next day, orangeade was made by mixing the same amount of orange juice with twice the amount of water. On both days, all the orangeade that was made was sold. If the revenue from selling the orangeade was the same for both days and if the orangeade was sold at $0.60 per glass on the first day, what was the price per glass on the second day?

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p><span>On the first day 1 unit of orange juice and 1 unit of water was used to make 2 units of orangeade;</span><br><span>On the second day 1 unit of orange juice and 2 units of water was used to make 3 units of orangeade;</span><br><br><span>So, the ratio of the amount of orangeade made on the first day to the amount of orangeade made on the second day is 2 to 3. Naturally the ratio of the # of glasses of orangeade made on the first day to the # of glasses of orangeade made on the second day is 2 to 3.</span><br><br><span>We are told that "the revenue from selling the orangeade was the same for both days" so the revenue from 2 glasses on the first day equals to the revenue from 3 glasses on the second day.</span><br><br><span>Say the price of the glass of the orangeade on the second day was $x then 2*0.6=3*x --&gt; x=$0.4.</span><br><br><span>Answer: D.</span><br><br><span>Hope it's clear.Â </span></p></div>
