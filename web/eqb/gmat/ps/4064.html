    At his regular hourly rate, Don had estimated the labor cost of a repair job as $336 and he was paid that amount. However, the job took 4 hours longer than he had estimated and, consequently, he earned $2 per hour less than his regular hourly rate. What was the time Don had estimated for the job, in hours?

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>(336/t)﹣[336/(t+4)]=2</p>
<p>解得 t(t+4)=672</p>
<p>将672因式分解，即2×3×4×4×7,  即24×28，t 取24，得解。</p></div>
