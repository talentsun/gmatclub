    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>首先看明白一些地方：就是A B C三个人合买 了一个radio。</p>
<p><b>A+B+C= total</b></p>
<p><b>C=2*A    </b><span> Coach paid twice as much as Archie</span></p>
<p><b>B&gt;C&gt;A  </b>   <span> Betty paid the most.</span></p>
<p><b>A=B-C-70  </b><span>Archie paid seventy dollars less than the difference between what Betty and Coach paid</span></p>
<p><b>2A+B+C-10-10=total=A+B+C  </b><span>If Archie had paid twice as much as he did pay, Betty and Coach would have each paid ten dollars less</span></p>
<p>根据以上式子，就不难算出A=20;C=40;B=130了</p>
