<div class="question" id="question_5647">
    If the probability is 0.54 that Stock A will increase in value during the next month and the probability is 0.68 that Stock B will increase in value during the next month, what is the greatest possible value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>we know that A and B are not independent events because 0.54+0.68=1.22&gt;1</p>
<p>draw venn diagram, two circles overlapping, and the number (let it be x) outside both circles is the probability that neither of these two events will occur. x is greatest when the numbers inside the circles and the overlapping part are 0, 0.54, 0.14.</p>
<p>So x=1-0.54-0.14=0.32.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>This is coyama, and I dont know why tongflio delete my explanation to this PS, but from my point of view, A and B are totally independent events, by common sense to what actual happen in the stock market, and by the nature of the question, coz there is no words indicates any corelation or interaction between A and B. </p>
<p>For A, the possibility of increase not happen during the next month is 1-0.54=0.46</p>
<p>For B, the possibility of increase not happen during the next month is 1-0.68=0.32</p>
<p>Since A and B is independent events, so the greatest possible value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is the value that B will occur, so the answer is 0.32.</p></div>
