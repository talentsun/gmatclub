    The passage supports which of the following statements about employees buying shares in their own companies?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1903" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>At three different companies, approximately nine out of ten of the workers were eligible to buy shares in their companies.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1903" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Approximately 90 percent of the eligible workers at three different companies chose to buy shares in their companies.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1903" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The opportunity to buy shares was discouraged by at least some labor unions.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1903" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Companies that demonstrated the highest productivity were the first to allow their employees the opportunity to buy shares.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1903" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Eligibility to buy shares was contingent on employees’ agreeing to increased work loads.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1903" value="B"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>此题要先抓住作者的观点 记得前面读过在最后一段employees and other individuals must make their own decisions to buy, and they must commit some of their own resources to the choice 就是让他们用他们自己的决定和自己的资源来买 看选项</p>
<p>A百分90的人有权利购买 这个好像不是作者说的买不买 选项说的是有没这权力</p>
<p>B这么多的人选择购买 这个和原文所说的让他们用自己的决定购买应该有点关系 先留下</p>
<p>C劳动联盟不鼓励买 这个和原文相差也太远了</p>
<p>D高效员工有优先权购买 这也和原文差远了</p>
<p>E购买权与工作负荷的关系 无关</p>
<p>只有B</p></div>
