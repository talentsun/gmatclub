    The passage suggests that tooth fractures in Pleistocene carnivores probably tended to occur less frequently

    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4281" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>	during periods in which more prey were available

    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4281" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>	at sites distant from the La Brea area

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>细节题，答案在最后一段。凭阅读记忆，回忆起只有最后一段解释了牙齿磨损的现象（第一段提出现象并说明现象有了解释，第二段排除了可能影响这个解释结论的他因，第三段给了解释）然后去看第三段，找到implies to the researchers either that prey availability was low, at least seasonally, or that there was intense competition over kills and a high rate of carcass theft due to relatively high predator densities，发现A是原文改写，选A.</p></div>
