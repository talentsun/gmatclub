<div class="question" id="question_1793">
    The passage suggests that the researchers mentioned in the second paragraph who observed anteaters break into a nest of ants would most likely agree with which of the following statements?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1793" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The event they observed provides conclusive evidence that anteaters use their electroreceptors to locate unseen prey.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1793" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The event they observed was atypical and may not reflect the usual hunting practices of anteaters.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1793" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>It is likely that the anteaters located the ants’ nesting chambers without the assistance of electroreceptors.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1793" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Anteaters possess a very simple sensory system for use in locating prey.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1793" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The speed with which the anteaters located their prey is greater than what might be expected on the basis of chance alone.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1793" value="E"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Such evidence is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">consistent </span>with<br>researchers’ <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hypothesis </span>that anteaters use electroreceptors<br>to detect electrical signals given off by prey; however,<br>( 20) researchers as yet <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>have been unable to detect</b></span> electrical<br>signals emanating from termite mounds, where the favorite<br>food of anteaters live.</p>
<p>A is wrong because this evidence is not conclusive.</p>
<p>pls repeat choice E agian, you will know what realy it means</p>
