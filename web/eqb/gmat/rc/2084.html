<div class="question" id="question_2084">
    The passage suggests that for an Andean highland village attempting to resolve the problem of unequal resource distribution, the strategy known as compressed verticality would probably be inappropriate for which of the following situations?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2084" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The village's location is such that it is difficult for the village to participate in long-distance trade networks.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2084" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The village does not have the resources to establish permanent satellite communities in production zones beyond the home community.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2084" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The warm-land crop regions nearest to the village are all below 6,000 feet.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2084" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>The location of the village does not provide ready access to an adequate variety of ecological zones.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2084" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The nearest crop production zones are located below the village, while the nearest pasturelands are located above the village.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2084" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>compressed verticality 定位</p>
<p><span>The first is "compressed verticality," in which a single village resides in a location that permits easy access to closely located ecological zones. Different crop zones or pasturelands are located within a few days walk of the parent community. Community members may reside temporarily in one of the lower zones to manage the extraction of products unavailable in the homeland. </span></p></div>
