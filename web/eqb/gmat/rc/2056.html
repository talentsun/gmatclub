    It can be inferred from the passage that the occasional failure of some salmon to return to their natal streams in order to spawn provides a mechanism by which

<p>Although the homing instinct of salmon to their natal stream is strong, a fraction of the fish <span style="text-decoration: underline;">returning from the sea </span>(rarely more than 15 percent)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> stray and spawn in nearby streams. </span>Low levels of straying are crucial, since the process provides a source of novel genes and a mechanism by which a location can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">repopulated</span> should the fish there disappear.</p>
<p>recolonized是repopulated的改写。</p>
<p>so D ：should引导一个虚拟语气的条件句。</p>
<p>should the fish there disappear = if the fish there should disappear</p></div>
