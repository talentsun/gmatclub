<div class="question" id="question_2320">
    Which of the following best states the main idea of the passage?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2320" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>In their definitions of the nature of ethnicity, sociologists have underestimated the power of the primordial human need to belong.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2320" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Ethnicity is best defined as a dynamic process that combines cultural components with shared political and economic interests.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2320" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>In the United States in the twentieth century, ethnic groups have begun to organize in order to further their political and economic interests.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2320" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Ethnicity in the United States has been significantly changed by the Civil Rights movement.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2320" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The two definitions of ethnicity that have dominated sociologists discussions are incompatible and should be replaced by an entirely new approach.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2320" value="B"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>the main ideal 出现在第一段While both of these definitions are useful, neither fully captures the dynamicand changing aspects of ethnicity in the United States.因此文章主要想要表述种族划分是一个文化和政治经济结合的动态过程。因此选择B</p></div>
