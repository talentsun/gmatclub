    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3689" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>showed by their behavior that they were reexperiencing the past</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3689" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>used information acquired through past experiences</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3689" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>assessed the freshness of food that had been stored by other jays</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3689" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>remembered what kind of food was stored in a particular location</span></div>

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>题目问的是，根据本文，作为scrub jays能binding information的证据是什么？那就是scrub jays做了某件事，让研究者觉得它由这个能力，只有D选项是按着原文正确描述了scrub jays做的事，“<span>remembered what kind of food was stored in a particular location”是what和where两个信息binding在一起了</span></p></div>
