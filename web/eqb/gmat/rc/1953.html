    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>定位原文<span>While in Japan and India the decline of British business was primarily a function of the rise of strong indigenous business groups, in Iran, by contrast, the government played a large role in both challenging British commercial interests and stimulating locally owned enterprise. </span></p>
<p>英国企业在日本和印度地位的下降是因为当地企业的崛起，by constrast强对比，在Iran，政府在挑战英国商业利益和同时刺激当地企业上发挥了large作用，</p>
<p>既然对比，就说明英国企业在日本和印度的decline是因为当地企业，而在Iran是因为政府的作用，所以可以推断日本和印度政府在当地英国企业的decline中起到了相对小的作用</p></div>
