<div class="question" id="question_1744">
    It can be inferred from information presented in the passage that if the density of the universe were equivalent to significantly less than three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter, which of the following would be true as a consequence?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1744" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Luminosity would be a true indicator of mass.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1744" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Different regions in spiral galaxies would rotate at the same velocity.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1744" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The universe would continue to expand indefinitely.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1744" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>The density of the invisible matter in the universe would have to be more than 70 times the density of the luminous matter.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1744" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>More of the invisible matter in spiral galaxies would have to be located in their nuclei than in their outer regions.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1744" value="C"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>可定位細節題－原句 “It can be calculated that the critical density of matter needed to brake the expansion and “close” the universe is equivalent to three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter.</p></div>
