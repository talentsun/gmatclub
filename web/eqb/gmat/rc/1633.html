    The researchers’ conclusion concerning the absence of demographic bias would be most seriously undermined if it were found that

    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1633" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>the average age at death of a present-day carnivore is greater than was the average age at death of a Pleistocene carnivore</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1633" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>in Pleistocene carnivore species, older individuals consumed carcasses as thoroughly as did younger individuals</span></div>
