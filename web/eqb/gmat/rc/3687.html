    The passage suggests that the “myth” mentioned in line 5 persists partly because
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3687" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>managers find it easier to compare their companies’ labor rates with those of competitors than to compare labor costs</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3687" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>managers tend to assume that labor rates affect their companies’ budgets less than they actually do</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3687" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>managers tend to believe that labor rates can have an impact on the efficiency of their companies’ work processes
</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3687" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>the average amount paid to workers differs significantly from one country to another</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_3687" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>many companies fail to rely on compensation consultants when making decisions about labor rates</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_3687" value="A"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>myth指的是： labor rates, the rate per hour paid to workers, are identical with labor costs, the money spent on labor in relation to the productivity of the labor force</p>
<p>表达的意思就是labor rates=labor costs</p>
<p>而下面有一句句子：The confusion of costs with rates <span style="background-color: #ff0;">persists partly </span>because labor rates are a convenient target for managers who want to make an impact on their company's budgets.  Because labor rates are highly visible, managers can easily compare their company's rates with those of competitors.</p>
<p>the confusion of costs with rates指的就是那个myth，也就是把labor rates和labor costs混淆成了同一个概念，那么把句子改写一下：myth persists partly because labor rates are a convenient target for managers who want to make an impact on their company's budget. Because labor rates are highly visible, managers can easily compare their company's rates with those of competitors</p></div>
