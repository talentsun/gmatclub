<div class="question" id="question_2026">
    Which of the following can be inferred from the passage about the effect of the solar-day cycle on the tide-associated periodic behavior displayed by commuter diatoms?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2026" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The solar-day cycle makes this behavior less advantageous to the commuter diatoms at certain times of the year.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2026" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The solar-day cycle makes this behavior somewhat more erratic.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2026" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The solar-day cycle makes this behavior less important to the survival of the commuter diatoms.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2026" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Because of the solar-day cycle, this behavior is forced to proceed at a more rapid pace at certain times during the 24-hour day.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2026" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Because of the solar-day cycle, this behavior is not expressed at certain times during the 24-hour day.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2026" value="E"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Commuter diatoms, for example, emerge only during those low tides that occur during the day. 此句可知，cd 在白天出现，即 晚上不出现。与 E 选项中 this behavior is not expressed at certain times during the 24-hour day 相呼应。</p></div>
