<div class="question" id="question_2159">
    According to the passage, which of the following is true about the role played by ground squirrels in the ecology of grassland-wetland complexes?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2159" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>While not important in the diet of raccoons or striped skunks, ground squirrels are a significant source of food for other waterfowl-nest predators.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2159" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Whereas ground squirrels are typically important as predators of songbird nests, their opportunistic predation on waterfowl nests also has an observable effect on waterfowl nesting success.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2159" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Although most waterfowl-nest predators prey on small mammals such as mice and ground squirrels, populations of ground squirrels tend to increase quickly enough to compensate for this level of predation.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2159" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Although ground squirrels have been known to prey on songbird nests, a larger portion of their diets is usually provided by predation on waterfowl nests.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2159" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Since larger predators tend to prefer small mammals to songbird eggs as a food source, a large population of  ground squirrels plays an important role in controlling opportunistic predation on songbird nests.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2159" value="A"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>根据文章可得出捕食路线：</p>
<p>waterfowl-nest predator 吃 little mammel（如mice、squirrel）</p>
<p>little mammel（如mice、squirrel）吃 songbird</p>
<p>解决该题需定位两处：</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">ground squirrels are important in the diet of many waterfowl-nest predators</span> and can themselves be important predators of songbird nets.</p>
<p>（A in the diet of B ， 则为B吃A）</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Neither raccoons norstriped skunks consume ground squirrels</span>, which are important predators of songbird nests.</p>
<p>两个高亮句为A的同义改写</p>
<p></p>
<p>本题比较难，需要两处的文字对应才能做出来，特别需要注意的是：一般意义上的文字对应法不适合此题，因为在第二段又一次提到了suqirrels。</p>
