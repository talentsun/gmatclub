<div class="question" id="question_2195">
    It can be inferred that the author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which of the following statements regarding the results of the recent experiments conducted by Sherwin's research team?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2195" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The experiments demonstrate that social learning in avian species facilitates the identification of noxious or toxic foods.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2195" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The experiments suggest that social learning has made avian species less adept than nonavian species at learning to prefer beneficial foods and avoid noxious and toxic foods.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2195" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The experiments undermine the notion that most avian species have evolved in environments where there is little benefit to the social learning of unpalatability.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2195" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>The experiments suggest that the acquisition of food preferences in avian species is largely unaffected by social learning.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2195" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The experiments show that social learning in avian species can promote the preferential consumption of beneficial foods but do not support the claim that social learning in avian species promotes the avoidance of noxious or toxic foods.</span></div>
