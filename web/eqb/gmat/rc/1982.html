<div class="question" id="question_1982">
    It can be inferred that the author of the passage believes which of the following about the study of Alessandra Strozzi done by the historian mentioned in the second paragraph?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1982" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Alessandra was atypical of her time and was therefore an inappropriate choice for the subject of the historian's research.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1982" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>In order to bolster her thesis, the historian adopted the anthropological perspective on personhood.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1982" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The historian argues that the boundaries of the conceptual self were not always firm and closed in Renaissance Europe.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1982" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>In her study, the historian reverts to a traditional approach that is out of step with the work of other historians of Renaissance Europe.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1982" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The interpretation of Alessandra's actions that the historian puts forward is not supported by much of the historian's research.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1982" value="E"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>还是主旨题  依然像上题一样 </p>
<p>A明显又是一个胡扯选项</p>
<p>B几样很不靠谱</p>
<p>C基本和原文最后一句意思差不多 但是不是原文支持的 似乎上题所读到的观点句中没有相关的 因为 Indeed后面的这些句子更像是其他人提出的一个观点 不大像是文章的主旨 </p>
<p>D也是无关 </p>
<p>E某人的行为不被历史学家支持 回忆下刚才我们读到的文章中心内容 his historian assumes that Alessandra had goals and interests different from those of her sons, yet much of the historian's own research reveals that Alessandra acted primarily as a champion of her sons' interests, taking their goals as her own. Thus Alessandra conforms more closely to the anthropologist's notion that personal motivation is embedded in a social context 所以正确为E</p></div>
