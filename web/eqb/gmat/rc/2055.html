<p>(C)Compare is not the main idea.</p>
<p>(D)Too specific</p>
<p>(E)The passage is primarily discuss the environmental and human activities are cause changes in salmon population.</p>
<p>large stretches of salmon habitat have been eliminated by human activity:mining, livestock grazing, timber harvesting, and agriculture as well as recreational and urban devel- opment. <b>The numerical effect </b>is obvious: there are fewer salmon in degraded regions than in pris- tine ones; however, habitat loss also has the potential to reduce genetic diversity. This is most evident in cases where it results in the extinction of entire salmon populations. <b>Indeed</b>, <b>most analysts believe </b>that some kind of environmental degradation underlies the demise of many extinct salmon populations. <b>Although</b> some rivers have been recolonized, the unique genes of the original populations have been lost.</p>
