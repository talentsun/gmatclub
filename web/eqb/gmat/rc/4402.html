<div class="question" id="question_4402">
    It can be inferred from the passage that if the S waves from an earthquake arrive at a given location long after the P waves, which of the following must be true? 
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4402" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The earthquake was a deep event. 


</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4402" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The earthquake was a shallow event. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4402" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The earthquake focus was distant. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4402" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>The earthquake focus was nearby. </span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4402" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The earthquake had a low peak intensity.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_4402" value="A"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>A 和C存在争议。但是A更好</p>
<p>因为the interval between their arrivals increases in proportion to <b>the distance from the earthquake focus,</b> or initial rupture point.<br>是到earthquake focus 距离增加，而不是earthquake focus 本身在深处，所以C不对</p>
<p> </p>
<p>另外，从Both the P-S intervals and the intensity patterns <b>suggested</b> two kinds of earthquakes可以看出，因为用的是both...and,所以单单据 P-S intervals 就可以推断出deep event,所以A是对的</p>
