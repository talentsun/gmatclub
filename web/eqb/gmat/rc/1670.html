    The passage suggests that the factor mentioned in highlight text complicates professors’ attempts to construct introductory reading lists for courses in Asian American studies in which of the following ways?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1670" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>By making it difficult for professors to identify primary source material and to obtain standard information on Asian American history and culture</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1670" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>By preventing professors from identifying excellent anthologies and introductory texts in the field that are both recent and understandable to students</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1670" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>By preventing professors from adequately evaluating the quality of the numerous texts currently being published in the field</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1670" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>By making it more necessary for professors to select readings for their courses that are not too challenging for students unfamiliar with Asian American history and culture</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1670" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>By making it more likely that the readings professors assign to students in their courses will be drawn solely from primary sources</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1670" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>原文：Such works would enable students taking Asian American studies courses (and professors in related fields) to look up basic information</p>
<p>professors might feel more free to include more challenging Asian American material in their introductory reading lists,</p>
<p>类似百科全书这样的资源可以提供一种基础的信息汇总，避免学生从海量的材料中自行提炼，从而教授也可以让学生在掌握基础背景的基础上，进一步学习更富有挑战的参考书目</p>
<p>A：无关：professor只提到给不给更challenging的材料，和提供标准之类的无关</p>
<p>B：无关：没有提及prevent，只是hard to select</p>
<p>C：无关：同上</p>
<p>D:correct：professor can't provide challenging material，just basic。</p>
<p>E：相反语义</p></div>
