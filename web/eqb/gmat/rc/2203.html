    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2203" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Whether age was the prevailing principle of social organization in Kenya before colonialism</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2203" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Whether gender was the primary determinant of social authority in Africa generally before colonialism</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2203" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Whether it was only after colonialism that gender became a significant determinant of authority in Kenyan society</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2203" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Whether age was a crucial factor determining authority in Africa after colonialism</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2203" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Whether British colonialism imposed European-style male-dominant notions upon local situations in Ghana</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2203" value="C"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>In Robertson'sÂ  mind, There is no doubt that age is the primary principle, before or after her research in Kenya. So the main controversial key is "gender". Therefore, the correct option should talk about gender, not age. we can rule out (A) and (D). As in (B), the primary determinant is awlays "age", so it is wrong. (E), there is no doubt that British colonialism imposed European-style male-dominant notions upon local situations in Ghana.<br>It left (C) as the right answer.</p></div>
