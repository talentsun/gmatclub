<div class="question" id="question_2096">
    According to the passage, which of the following statements about sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs is true?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2096" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Older production technologies cannot be adapted so as to reduce production of these outputs as waste products.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2096" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Under the most recent environmental regulations, industrial plants are no longer permitted to produce these outputs.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2096" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Although these outputs are environmentally hazardous, some plants still generate them as waste products despite the high compliance costs they impose.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2096" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Many older plants have developed innovative technological processes that reduce the amounts of these outputs generated as waste products.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2096" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Since the production processes that generate these outputs are less costly than alternative processes, these less expensive processes are sometimes adopted despite their acknowledged environmental hazards.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2096" value="C"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>看完选项定位到New regulations have imposed extensive compliance costs on companies still using older industrial coal-fired burners that generate high sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide outputs,但是题目问的是According to the passage,  which of the following statements is true?所以我们要找的是主旨 不难发现主旨应该是Finally, older production technologies often continue to generate toxic wastes that were not regulated when the technology was first adopted 说的是老旧的机器依然生产当他们一开始被接受的时候 所以看选项</p>
<p>A和原文所记比较贴切</p>
<p>B并未说不再等到允许这事吧</p>
<p>C说依然有人生产 这和我们所记内容还是有所出入的</p>
<p>D老厂创新了？原文有说吗</p>
<p>E所述也和所读内容相差太远</p>
