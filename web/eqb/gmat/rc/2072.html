<div class="question" id="question_2072">
    The passage suggests that WIDC differed from WTUL in which of the following ways?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2072" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>WIDC believed that the existing safety regulations were adequate to protect women's health, whereas WTUL believed that such regulations needed to be strengthened.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2072" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>WIDC believed that unions could not succeed in pressuring employers to comply with such regulations, whereas WTUL believed that unions could succeed in doing so.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2072" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>WIDC believed that lead poisoning in white lead factories could be avoided by controlling conditions there, whereas WTUL believed that lead poisoning in such factories could not be avoided no matter how stringently safety regulations were enforced.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2072" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>At the time that the legislation concerning white lead factories was proposed, WIDC was primarily concerned with addressing health conditions in white lead factories, whereas WTUL was concerned with improving working conditions in all types of factories.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2072" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>At the time that WIDC was opposing legislative attempts to restrict women's labor, WTUL had already ceased to do so.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2072" value="E"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>看了题目　问WIDC 与WTUL不同之处　这种作法就是能找出两个是两个　但有的题目不会像此题一样　同时给出两个东西　因阅读记忆量也会比较大　加上这样的做法也比较充分　不是ＧＭＡＣ所倡导的思维方式　一般找到一个用有关无关就能做出答案　因为此题WIDC的观点在前面的题目中就读到了　所以阅读量就比较小　当然我习惯是直接读WTUL的观点　因为在后面出现　WTUL的观点再多也就几行而WIDC的观点怕会藏在中间某部分　所以先看看文章最后　记住了cease　to oppose restrictions on women's labor，support　enacted proposal　因为safety regulations无法被实施　看到safety regulations自然想到前面所读关于WIDC的没有 discount　potential health 和 limitingopportunities　当然我原本做此题时只准备用WTUL就杀掉所有选项　WIDC只是前面做完题目记得的部分　看选项先找WTUL杀掉ＡＢＤ　因为所提内容都没见过　剩下ＣＥ　再看具体内容　全都是细节　没有什么相同的地方　逼着我只能用WIDC　用所记内容一对只有Ｃ可选</p></div>
