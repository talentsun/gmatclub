    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>D答案In contrast to the socialists, the communists sought to more directly address the needs of the Black community. They also organized the International Labor Defense, a legal arm that was designed to defend communists in the courts。</p>
<p>至于B答案，我个人觉得文章中并没有提出来，文章只说不会选择什么方向，而没有说会选择什么方向。 The direction was not, however, to the extreme left, despite the wooing of the socialists and the communists.</p></div>
