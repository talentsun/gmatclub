    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>应提供kaogmat服务给我们的lanslot大神要求，详解一下这道题。</p>
<p>正确答案在B和D之间，个人更支持D.</p>
<p>先说文章大意：</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why firms adhere to or deviate from their strategic plans is poorly understood. </span></p>
<p>提出一个问题，引向文章主题。作者认为影响企业是否一贯采用战略计划的原因目前被很多人曲解了。这是作者的观点。However, theory andlimited research suggest that the process through which such plans emerge may play a part. 引出一个客观实际，目前的理论和有限的研究表明这些战略计划产生的过程是企业对该战略计划采用与否的原因。In particular, top management decision-sharing- consensus-oriented, team-based decision-making - may increase the likelihood that firms will adhere to their plans, because those involved in the decision-making may be more committed to the chosen course of action, thereby increasing the likelihood that organizations will subsequently adhere to their plans.这句话这里就是2040这道题的问题所在。开头是in particular,证明是接着前面那句话说的，给前面那句话进行详细阐述。这样就不难看出，第一段第二句话开头的however是个让步而非转折，因为作者的态度是第一句话。<br><br><span>However, the relationship between top management decision-sharing and adherence to plans may be affected by a firm's strategic mission (its fundamental approach to increasing sales revenue and market share, and generating cash flow and short-term profits).</span> 问题2040问这句话在文章中的作用。这个however是针对前面从第一个however(第一段第二句话）到第一段结束的整体内容来的。抛开他们说了什么不看，连续两个however双重否定，那么作者的态度是否又回到第一句话了呢？到此为止，作者其实给了几个信息：</p>
<p>1、process play a part.</p>
<p>top management decision-sharing may increase the likelihood that firms will adhere to plans</p>
<p>2、relationship between top management decision-sharing and adhereance may be affected by firm's strategic mission</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ff0;">因此是mission主导relationship between management D and adhereance, 而management D 影响likelihood</span></p>
<p>根据这一点，再来看四个选项：</p>
<p>A说解决为什么公司采用计划的问题 没有解决，因为在第二段第一句话的动词用的是may,证明作者用并不强硬的语气来反对了前面那些研究和理论证明了什么这个观点。</p>
<p>B说refute, refute这个词很强硬，如果作者用了may,一般不考虑。——这是从态度方面看。从具体内容上看，B说作者否认了第一段关于高管们对于公司是否采纳战略计划的影响，第一段说的其实是高管影响likelihood而非直接影响是否采纳。而第二段也并非否定，尽管有个however,它只是说第一段第二句话认为的那件事并非那么绝对——因为top management decision sharing本身也是被其他条件影响的——而不是否定了第一句话。</p>
<p>C提出证据支持....完全没有提出证据，排除</p>
<p>D 评价前一句话</p>
<p>E 解释后面的话 这个也不对。</p>
<p>综上所述，参考排除后的和对B的分析，本题应该是选D.</p>
<p>At one end of the strategic mission continuum, "build" strategies are pursued when a firm desires to increase its market share and is willing to sacrifice short-term profits to do so. At the other end, "harvest" strategies are used when a firm is willing to sacrifice market share for short-term profitability and cash-flow maximization.</p>
<p>at one end...at another...给了两种strategies的类型：build and harvest,告诉你分别用于什么时候</p>
<p> Research and theory suggest that top management decision-sharing may have a more positive relationship with adherence to plans among firms with harvest strategies than among firms with build strategies.</p>
<p>告诉你build和harvest两种类型的strategy中，management decision sharing对harvest的正向作用更大。</p>
<p> In a study of strategic practices in several large firms, managers in harvest strategy scenarios were more able to adhere to their business plans. As one of the managers in the study explained it, this is partly because "<i>typically all a manager has to do when implementing a harvest strategy is that which was done last year.</i>" Additionally, managers under harvest strategies mayhave fewer strategic options than do those under build strategies; it may therefore be easier to reach agreement on a particular course of action through decision-sharing, which will in turn tend to promote adherence to plans.</p>
<p>in a study...证明是具体的内容，为前面的概念举出的实例，证实前面的概念。每句话都没有作者态度的转折。</p>
<p>Conversely, in a "build" strategy scenario, individual leadership, rather than decision-sharing, may promote adherence to plans. Build strategies - which typically require leaders with strong personal visions for a firm's future, rather than the negotiated compromise of the team-based decision - may be most closely adhered to when implemented in the context of a clear strategic vision of an individual leader, rather than through the practice of decision-sharing.</p>
<p>conversely，虽然是转折词，但只是接着上面说build strategy是怎样的，因此依然是对第二段第一句话和第二句话的持续解释。</p>
<p>综上所述，本段落细读部分应该是第一段1，2句和第二段1，2句，基本上其余部分总体用不到2分钟的时间跳读就可以搞定所有题了。</p></div>
