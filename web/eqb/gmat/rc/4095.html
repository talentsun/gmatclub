<div class="question" id="question_4095">
    Which of the following, if true, would most clearly support the argument about keystone status advanced in the last sentence of the passage?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4095" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>A species of bat is primarily responsible for keeping insect populations within an ecosystem low, and the size of the insect population in turn affects bird species within that ecosystem.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4095" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>A species of iguana occupies a keystone role on certain tropical islands, but does not play that role on adjacent tropical islands that are inhabited by a greater number of animal species.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4095" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Close observation of a savannah ecosystem reveals that more species occupy keystone roles within that ecosystem than biologists had previously believed.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4095" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>As a keystone species of bee becomes more abundant it has a larger effect on the ecosystem it inhabits.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4095" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>A species of moth that occupies a keystone role in a prairie habitat develops coloration patterns that camouflage it from potential predators.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_4095" value="B"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Keystone status appears to depend on context, whether of particular geography or of <b>such factors as community diversity </b>(for example, <b>a reduction in species diversity may thrust more of the remaining species       into keystone roles</b>) and length of species interaction (since newly arrived species in particular may dramatically affect ecosystem).</p>
<p>B is the case of community diverstity.</p>
<p>B项adjacent tropical islands 对应原文particular geography ；a greater number of animal species对应原文community diversity；并且选项例子中species的验证正如原文所说newly arrived species。而A项只是说明一个生物链现象。</p>
<p><span>B选项只对应 species diversity这一项，原文说有可能diversity减少，使更多的剩余的物种成为keystone, 选项B中的adjacent tropical islands that are inhabited by a greater number of animal species与原文情况相反，物种的diversity增加使iguana occupies不再是keystone.</span></p></div>
