<div class="question" id="question_4172">
    Kirmani's third study, as described in the passage, suggests which of the following conclusions about a black-and-white advertisement?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4172" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>It can be repeated more frequently than a comparable color advertisement could before consumers begin to suspect low manufacturer confidence in the quality of the advertised product.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4172" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>It will have the greatest impact on consumers' perceptions of the quality of the advertised product if it appears during periods when a color version of the same advertisement is also being used.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4172" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span> It will attract more attention from readers of the print publication in which it appears if it is used only a few times.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4172" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>It may be perceived by some consumers as more expensive than a comparable color advertisement.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_4172" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>It is likely to be perceived by consumers as a sign of higher manufacturer confidence in the quality of the advertised product than a comparable color advertisement would be.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_4172" value="A"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p> 最后一句： the point at which repetition of an advertisement is perceived as excessive comes sooner for a color advertisement than for a black-and-white advertisement</p>
<p>彩色广告不断重复比黑白广告不断重复 更让人觉得 excessive</p>
<p>正是A所说的 消费者能接受重复出现的次数，黑白的比彩色的多</p></div>
</div>
