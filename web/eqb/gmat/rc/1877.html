<div class="question" id="question_1877">
    The passage suggests that which of the following is a prediction concerning meteor streams that can be derived from both the conventional theories mentioned in highlight text and the new computer-derived theory?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1877" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Dust particles in a meteor stream will usually be distributed evenly throughout any cross section of the stream.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1877" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The orbits of most meteor streams should cross the orbit of the Earth at some point and give rise to a meteor shower.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1877" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Over time the distribution of dust in a meteor stream will usually become denser at the  outside edges of the stream than at the center.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1877" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Meteor showers caused by older meteor streams should be on average, longer in  duration than those caused by very young meteor streams。</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1877" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The individual dust particles in older meteor streams should be, on average, smaller than those that compose younger meteor streams.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1877" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Conventional view:Astronomers have hypothesized that a meteor stream should broaden with time as the dust particles'</p>
<p>Computer model:that the computer model stream broadened with time.</p>
