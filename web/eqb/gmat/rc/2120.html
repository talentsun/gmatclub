<div class="question" id="question_2120">
    According to the author of the passage, which of the following is true of the distribution of the income derived from the total output of consumer goods in a modern economy?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2120" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Workers receive a share of this income that is significantly smaller than the value of their labor as a contribution to total output.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2120" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Owners of capital goods receive a share of this income that is significantly greater than the contribution to total output attributable to the use of capital goods.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2120" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Owners of capital goods receive a share of this income that is no greater than the proportion of total output attributable to the use of capital goods.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2120" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Owners of capital goods are not fully compensated for their investment because they pay out most of their share of this income to workers as wages and benefits.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2120" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Workers receive a share of this income that is greater than the value of their labor because the labor theory of value overestimates their contribution to total output.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2120" value="C"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>1/3的total output 给capital goods</p>
<p>2/3的income 给 workers</p>
<p>1/3的income 给 owners of capital goods</p>
<p>income来自 total outputs ,是总产出的子集</p>
<p>因此 选C</p></div>
