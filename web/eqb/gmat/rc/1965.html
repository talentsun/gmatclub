<div class="question" id="question_1965">
    According to the passage, Gurney refined the use of ilmenites in prospecting for diamonds in which of the following ways?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1965" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>He found that ilmenites are brought up from the mantle by kimberlite pipes and erode out into the surrounding land in greater quantities than diamonds.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1965" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>He found that since ilmenites do not form in the diamond-stability field, their presence indicates the absence of diamonds.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1965" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>He showed that highly oxidized iron content in ilmenites indicates a low survival rate for diamonds.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1965" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>He found that when the iron in ilmenites is highly oxidized, conditions in the magma were probably conducive to the formation of diamonds.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1965" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>He showed that ilmenites take on more or less oxygen in the kimberlite pipe depending on the concentration of diamonds.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1965" value="C"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Gurney also found that though ilmenites did not form in the diamond-stability field, there was a link <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">useful for prospectors</span>:  when the iron in ilmenite was highly oxidized, its source pipe rarely contained any diamonds.  </p></div>
