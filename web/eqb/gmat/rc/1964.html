    The passage suggests that the presence of G10 garnet in a kimberlite pipe indicates that
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1964" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>the pipe in which the garnet is found has a 90% chance of containing diamonds</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1964" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>the levels of calcium and chrome in the pipe are conducive to diamond formation</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1964" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>the pipe passed through a diamond-stability field and thus may contain diamonds</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1964" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>any diamonds the pipe contains would not have come from the diamond-stability field</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1964" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>the pipe's temperature was so high that it oxidized any diamonds the pipe might have contained</span></div>

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>答案可能就在第二段的开头那句话：In the 1970's <span style="background-color: #ff0;">the process of locating profitable pipes </span>was refined by focusing on the subtle differences between <span style="background-color: #ff0;">the chemical signatures </span>of indicator minerals found in diamond-rich pipes as opposed to those found in barren pipes.表明了indicator mineral 的 chemical signature 与钻石的丰富与否有着直接的关系。</p></div>
