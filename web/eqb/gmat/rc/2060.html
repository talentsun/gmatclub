    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>问题问关于supplier partnerships，</p>
<p>定位原文With "indirect" purchases (such as computers, advertising, and legal services), which are not directly related to production, corporations often favor "supplier partnerships" (arrangements in which the purchaser forgoes the right to pursue alternative suppliers), which can inappropriately shelter suppliers from rigorous competitive scrutiny that might afford the purchaser economic leverage.</p>
<p>说的是伴随着不直接的购买，公司通常会喜欢supplier partnerships，这个是公司经常会放弃追逐可替代的供应商，<span style="text-decoration: underline;">但是这个供应合作商的关系会不适当地给一些供应商进行庇护，而让这些供应商免于严苛的市场检验，而这些市场检验会负担买方的经济杠杆。</span></p>
<p>也就是说，原文对于这个supplier partnerships是否定的态度，且应该是跟供应商和买方的购买价格等有关。</p>
<p>其他均为无关选项。所以B</p></div>
