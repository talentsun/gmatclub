    According to the passage, compared with women in eighteenth-century Connecticut, men were
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2174" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>more likely to rely on credit and go into debt</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2174" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>more likely to pursue their families' debtors</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2174" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>more likely to participate in economic transactions outside their own communities</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2174" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>less likely to perform economic services in their own communities.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2174" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>less likely to participate in civil cases that were not debt-related.</span></div>

    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>这题的定位应该是这里：<span>Men's commercial interests and credit networks became <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">increasingly far-flung</span>, .... At the same time, women's networks of credit and debt remained primarily <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">local and personal</span>. 既然men的影响力更加深远 -- 跟women的local and personal形成反差，也就是说men一般都是outside of "local" and non-personal的了。</span></p></div>
