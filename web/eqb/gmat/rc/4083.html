    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p> "Some <span>scholars</span> have argued that Garvey <b>created</b> the consciousness .... <b>But</b>.... Garvey <b>did not create </b>this consciousness; rather,...key word：create</p>
<p>the most different between scholars and the others is <b>create or not</b></p>
<p><b>-------</b></p>
<p><b>in order to get the correct answer, let us find some key words in these options:</b></p>
<p><b>A.</b><span><span style="background-color: #ff0;"><b>Revitalization</b></span> resulted from the political activism of returning African American soldiers following the First World War.</span></p>
<p><b>B.</b><span>Marcus Garvey had to change a number of prevailing attitudes in order for his mass movement to find a foothold in the United States.</span></p>
<p><b>C.</b><span>The <span style="background-color: #ff0;"><b>prevailing</b></span> sensibility of the African American community provided the foundation of Marcus Garvey’s political appeal.</span></p>
<p><b>D.</b><span>Marcus Garvey hoped to<b><span style="background-color: #ff0;"> revitalize </span></b>consciousness of cultural and historical identity in the African American community.</span></p>
<p><b>E.</b><span>The goal of the mass movement that Marcus Garvey helped bring into being was to <b><span style="background-color: #ff0;">build on </span></b>the pride and unity among African Americans.</span></p>
<p>thses four highlight words show something has already existed before the G's arriving,means " not created"</p>
<p>--------</p>
<p>B: Although there is a "prevailing", the word decorate the attitudes, rather than the consciousness. so B means "created", and is correct.</p></div>
