    The author of the passage implies which of the following about the poetry mentioned in the first paragraph?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2125" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Wulf exaggerates the degree to which young women from an elite background regarded the poetry as providing a critique of marriage.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2125" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The circulation of the poetry was confined to young Quaker women.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2125" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Young women copied the poetry into their commonplace books because they interpreted it as providing a desirable model of unmarried life.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2125" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>The poetry's capacity to influence popular attitudes was restricted by the degree of literacy necessary to comprehend it.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2125" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The poetry celebrated marital beliefs and practices that were in opposition to patriarchal marriage.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2125" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>题目问的是作者的观点，注意本文有学者Wulf的观点和作者的观点，两个不同的观点，作者的对poetry的观点在第二段第二句体现，说到要理解诗歌至少要3年的文学学习，这是作者的观点，对应选项D；而选项E说poetry是反对夫权婚姻的，注意<span>marital beliefs and practices that were in opposition to patriarchal marriage,这句话是来自文章末尾<span>Popular literary satires on marriage had already landed on fertile ground in a multiethnic population that embodied a wide range of marital beliefs and practices，所以marital beliefs and practices that were in opposition to patriarchal marriag是来自已经流传广泛的popular literary，不是poetry，这个选项明显偷换概念了</span></span></p></div>
