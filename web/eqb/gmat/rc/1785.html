    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1785" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Thus Wynne-Edwards’s theory raises serious questions about the constancy of animal population in a region.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1785" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Because Wynne-Edwards’s theory is able to explain more kinds of animal behavior than is the density-dependent theory, epideictic explanations of population regulation are now widely accepted.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1785" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The results of one study, for instance, have suggested that group vocalizing is more often used to defend territory than to provide information about population density.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1785" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Some of these studies have, in fact, worked out a systematic and complex code of social behavior that can regulate population size.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1785" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>One study, for example, has demonstrated that birds are more likely to use winter-roosting aggregations than group vocalizing in order to provide information on population size.</span></div>
