<div class="question" id="question_2069">
    Which of the following, if true, would most clearly support the contention attributed to SPEW in highlight text?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2069" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Those white lead factories that most strongly enforced regulations concerning worker safety and hygiene had the lowest incidences of lead poisoning among employees.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2069" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>The incidence of lead poisoning was much higher among women who worked in white lead factories than among women who worked in other types of factories.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2069" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>There were many household sources of lead that could have contributed to the incidence of lead poisoning among women who also worked outside the home in the late nineteenth century.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2069" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>White lead factories were more stringent than were certain other types of factories in their enforcement of workplace safety regulations.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2069" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Even brief exposure to the conditions typically found in white lead factories could cause lead poisoning among factory workers.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2069" value="A"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>问支持这处的　那就先看看这处说什么吧　就说什么企业要佳丽　因为这个病是可避免的如果工人更干净还有安全法规被严格执行　记住所读因为问下面哪个是支持的所以可以放心大胆看选项　</p>
<p>Ａ前半部分加强法规的企业有最低的发病人　这和原文所读有些关系　不好说是正确　先放着</p>
<p>Ｂ中毒人数在这企业和其他企业相比　至少比Ａ差多了</p>
<p>Ｃ完全一个没见过的选项内容　果断大胆秒杀</p>
<p>Ｄ此选项也比Ａ差多了　和原文我们刚才所读内容相比可以说基本内容不相关</p>
<p>Ｅ哪怕一点点的暴露也会得病　这恐怕也和Ａ差多了吧　所读内容只有Ａ比较相近</p>
<p>阅读的这种排除和ＣＲ还是有不同的　不能因为没见过就把一整个选项杀掉　哪怕有一点点沾边都要留着　而ＣＲ是只要内容性质没说过肯定杀　所以这种感觉上还是有不同的</p></div>
