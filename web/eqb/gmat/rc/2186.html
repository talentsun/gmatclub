<div class="question" id="question_2186">
    Which of the following, if true, would most clearly undermine the possible explanation for the whirling gas in M87 that is mentioned in the last sentence of the first paragraph?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2186" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>The stars in a star cluster at the center of M87 could exert a strong gravitational force without tearing the cluster apart.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2186" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>A cluster of stars at the center would preclude the existence of certain other astronomical phenomena that have been observed at the center of M87.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2186" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>The stars within many existing galaxies, such as NGC 4258, are more closely spaced than are the stars within the core of M87.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2186" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Only one other galaxy has been observed to contain gas clouds whirling about its center as they do about the core of M87.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2186" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The gravitational force of a cluster of a billion or so dim stars would be sufficient to cause a whirling ring of gas and dust to collect around the center of a galaxy.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2186" value="B"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>个人认为正确答案应该为A。</p>
<p>问题问的有点隐晦， 要undermine 的不是第一段的最后一句， 而是在最后一句当中提到的whiling gas in M87的可能的解释。</p>
<p>在第二段中， 可能的解释是， If the center of NGC 4258 were a star cluster, the stars would be so closely spaced that collisions between individual stars would have long ago torn the cluster apart.</p>
<p>而选项A正好undermine 了这种可能的推测。</p>
<p> <span>The stars in a star cluster at the center of M87 could exert a strong gravitational force without tearing the cluster apart.</span></p></div>
