    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>Logical structure</p>
<p>The author discusses the many service workers<br> employed by manufacturers to illustrate the failure<br> of the government's definition to distinguish<br> between service industries and service<br> occupations. The resulting ambiguities, in the<br> author's view, reveal the arbitrariness of the<br> definition and its inaccuracy in reflecting the<br> composition of the economy.</p>
<p>A    The worker is covered but misclassified.</p>
<p>B     Correct. The author uses this example to<br> point out a serious shortcoming in the<br> government's definition.</p>
<p>C    The author mentions the growth of services<br> at the beginning of the passage but does not<br> explore the reasons for it.</p>
<p>D    The situation of service workers employed by<br> manufacturers is just the reverse; they are<br> categorized by the company's final product,<br> not by the work they do.</p>
<p>E     The author had earlier cited and illustrated<br> the diversity of service activities that are<br> included in the government's residual<br> category of services; the focus here is instead<br> the arbitrariness and inaccuracy, in the<br> author's view, of the government's definition.</p>
<p>The correct answer is B.</p></div>
