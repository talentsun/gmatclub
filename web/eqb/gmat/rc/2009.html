<div class="question" id="question_2009">
    Which of the following, if true, would most clearly undermine the author's statement in the last sentence of the passage regarding the distribution of wealth in Western Pueblo settlements?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2009" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Only community members of exceptional wealth are likely to have been buried with their personal possessions.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2009" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Members of communities with extensive agricultural systems are usually buried without personal possessions.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2009" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Most artifacts found in burial sites were manufactured locally rather than imported from other communities.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2009" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Burial artifacts are often ritual objects associated with religious practices rather than being the deceased's personal possessions.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2009" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>The quality of burial artifacts varies depending on the site with which they are associated.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2009" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>D答案的意思是：葬礼的工艺品是礼仪宗教性质的物品，而不是属于私人的。说明Western Pueblo的财富不是属于少数人，削弱了文章中说的“等级制度”“财富属于少数人”等等陈述。</p></div>
