<div class="question" id="question_2134">
    Which of the following, if true, would most clearly serve to weaken the author's claim about what constitutes a reasonable yardstick for measuring patent quality?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2134" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>It is more difficult to have an article accepted for publication in the technical literature of the semiconductor industry than it is in the technical literature of most other industries.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2134" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Many of the highest-quality semiconductor patents are cited numerous times in the technical literature.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2134" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>It is difficult for someone not familiar with the technical literature to recognize what constitutes an innovative semiconductor patent.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2134" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>There were more citations made per semiconductor patent in the technical literature in the 1970's than in the 1980's.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_2134" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Low-quality patents tend to be discussed in the technical literature as frequently as high-quality patents.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_2134" value="E"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>作者的观点是认为citation的次数是合理的衡量标准，次数多专利的质量越高，题目要求找出weaken作者观点的选项，E选项说低质量的专利和高质量的专利在技术资料中被讨论的次数可能一样多，很好的削弱了作者的观点。</p></div>
