<div class="question" id="question_1946">
    According to the passage, which of the following is the reason why short-term price promotions do not attract new long-term customers to a brand?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1946" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Short-term price promotions do not produce an increase in sales.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1946" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Customers come to regard the promotional price as the fair price and the regular price as excessive.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1946" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Most customers select among competing products largely on the basis of price and very few are loyal to any particular brand.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1946" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Customers who have not previously bought the promoted brand are almost never persuaded to do so by the short-term price promotions.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1946" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Any customers that a brand gains by means of a short-term price promotion are liable to be lost when a competing brand has a similar promotion.</span></div>
    <input class="c-option" type="hidden" name=" question_1946" value="D"/>
    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>看完问题定位到第一段A price promotion does not increase the number of long-term customers of a brand, as it attracts virtually no new customers in the first place应该是不难的 同时定位完成后习惯性的前后看看 在这句后面说的是坏的影响 造成品牌名声什么的 和问题无关 下一段则是说公司热衷于做promotion的原因 和问题基本无关 所以再往前看看 因为刚才我们所定位到的句子不能回答问题 是一句比较空的话 再往前看 people seldom buy an unfamiliar brand merely because the price is reduced. They simply avoid paying more than they have to when one of their customary brands is temporarily available at a reduced price 这句其实是解释前面一句话的内容 A price promotion entices only a brand's long-term or "loyal" customers 而且无法回答问题 说的是忠实消费者的消费习惯 而主要说的大意是围绕 价格促销只是给忠实消费者和长期消费者实惠 而再往前则是空话了 所以看到此就用此做题 记住了 价格促销只是给忠实消费者和长期消费者实惠 看完选项只有D的意思上对 虽然其单词都没见过</p></div>
