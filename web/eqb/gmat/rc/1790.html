<div class="question" id="question_1790">
    Which of the following can be inferred about the experiment described in the first paragraph?
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1790" value="A."/><b>A.</b><span>Researchers had difficulty verifying the existence of electroreceptors in the anteater because electroreceptors respond to such a narrow range of electrical field strengths.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1790" value="B."/><b>B.</b><span>Researchers found that the level of nervous activity in the anteater’s brain increased dramatically as the strength of the electrical stimulus was increased.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1790" value="C."/><b>C.</b><span>Researchers found that some areas of the anteater’s snout were not sensitive to a weak electrical stimulus.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1790" value="D."/><b>D.</b><span>Researchers found that the anteater’s tactile receptors were more easily excited by a strong electrical stimulus than were the electroreceptors.</span></div>
    <div><input class="option" type="radio" name=" question_1790" value="E."/><b>E.</b><span>Researchers tested small areas of the anteater’s snout in order to ensure that only electroreceptors were responding to the stimulus.</span></div>
