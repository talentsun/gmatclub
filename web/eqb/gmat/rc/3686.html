    <div class="explanation" style="display:none"><p>he correct answer is (E). Reasons are presented below.<br>Option (a) They feared that their party was losing its strong moral foundation. this option is based on original setences "women who turned out at the party's rallies gathered information that enabled them to mold party-loyal families, reminded men of moral values that transcended party loyalty, and conferred moral standing on the party." As you can see, it has nothing to do with "strong moral foundation".</p>
<p>Option (B), in the article, they only said those women "mold party-loyal families", which means they help to win some royalty for Whigs, but it doesn't mention that they help whigs to win in many elections.</p>
<p>Option (C), "the ideology that justified such inclusion had been assimilated by the Democrats." means Democrats assimilate the ideology that justified the inclusion of women in the rituals of party politics. "Assimilate" means "accept", not "creat".</p>
<p>Option (D), the paragraph mentioned nothing about "the woman’s rights movement".</p>
<p>Option (E) "Virginia Democrats, in response, began to make similar appeals to women as well." supports "They imitated the Whigs’ efforts to include women in the rituals of party politics." "Imitate" means "to copy", so here "make similar appeals" suggest Democrats imitated the Whigs.</p></div>
